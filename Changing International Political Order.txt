7 Changing International Political Order 
 
 

Q.1) Discuss the relevance of the normative ethos of the Non-Aligned Movement in magnifying India's soft 
power in pursuit of her national Interest. (2023) (20 Marks) 

 
Approach to write the answer 

 
Introduction:  
• Introduce how the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) has contributed to India’s soft power and its global 

influence by promoting sovereignty and independence in foreign policy. 
Body:  
• Explain how NAM's principles align with India's historical emphasis on strategic autonomy, bolstering 

its leadership in global forums, navigating contemporary issues like the Russia-Ukraine conflict, and 
promoting initiatives like climate change and vaccine diplomacy. 

Conclusion:  
• Conclude by highlighting that NAM’s ethos has strengthened India's soft power, fostering alliances and 

enhancing its global standing. 
 
The normative ethos of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) has significantly contributed to India's soft power 
and its pursuit of national interests on the global stage. Founded in 1961 during the Cold War, NAM advocated 
for sovereignty, peace, and non-alignment from the U.S.-Soviet rivalry, promoting an independent foreign 
policy. India's role as a founding member has reinforced its image as a leader of the Global South, allowing it 
to amplify its influence and achieve strategic goals without resorting to hard power. Joseph Nye, who coined 
the term "soft power," emphasized the role of values, culture, and diplomacy in gaining international 
influence, all of which resonate with NAM’s ethos in India's foreign policy approach. 

NAM's principles—sovereignty, peaceful coexistence, and anti-colonialism—align with India’s historical 
emphasis on strategic autonomy, giving it a moral high ground that appeals to many developing countries. As 
Bhikhu Parekh discusses in Gandhi’s Political Philosophy: A Critical Examination, India’s approach to foreign 
policy, deeply rooted in Gandhian ideals of non-violence and moral leadership, has reinforced its standing 
among nations with similar post-colonial experiences. This non-aligned stance, which remains central to India's 
diplomacy, has enabled it to gain allies in global forums, as seen in India's recent successes in securing support 
for a permanent UN Security Council seat from several African and Asian countries. 

The NAM legacy has also allowed India to navigate contemporary issues effectively. India's stance on the 
Russia-Ukraine conflict, where it has advocated dialogue over taking sides, is a reflection of NAM's principles. 
By doing so, India maintains positive relations with both Western powers and Russia, showcasing its 
commitment to independence in foreign policy. This balanced approach has enhanced India's credibility as a 
neutral power, especially among countries wary of Western hegemony, helping India pursue economic and 
political partnerships across diverse blocs. 

Additionally, NAM’s ethos has bolstered India’s leadership on issues like climate change and global health, 
where it emphasizes equity and shared responsibility. For instance, the International Solar Alliance, 
spearheaded by India, reflects its commitment to sustainable development while appealing to other

developing nations. Similarly, during the COVID-19 pandemic, India’s “Vaccine Maitri” initiative, providing 
vaccines to over 100 countries, was seen as an extension of NAM’s principles, elevating India’s reputation as 
a responsible global actor. 

NAM’s normative framework has provided India with a powerful soft power tool that aligns with its aspirations 
for strategic autonomy, fostering alliances across the Global South and enhancing its global influence. 

 
Q.2) Discuss the various constraints on American hegemony today. Which of these are likely to become more 

prominent in the future? (2023) (15 Marks) 
 

Approach to write the answer 

 
Introduction:  
• Introduce the decline of American hegemony due to global and domestic challenges. 
Body:  
• Explain key constraints such as China’s rise, U.S. economic strain, and ideological shifts weakening soft 

power. 
Conclusion:  
• Highlight the likely future shift from unipolarity to a multipolar world with competing powers. 

 
American hegemony, once considered unassailable in the post-Cold War period, now faces significant 
constraints due to a combination of geopolitical, economic, and ideological challenges. Scholars like Fareed 
Zakaria in The Post-American World (2008) and Joseph Nye in The Future of Power (2011) have highlighted the 
limitations on U.S. dominance, driven by the rise of other global powers, internal economic pressures, and the 
shifting nature of global influence. 

One major constraint is the rise of China as a competing superpower. China’s rapid economic growth and 
military expansion pose a direct challenge to American influence, particularly in Asia. China’s Belt and Road 
Initiative (BRI), which has invested billions into infrastructure across Asia, Africa, and Europe, is reshaping 
global trade routes and consolidating Chinese influence across the developing world. Additionally, China’s 
focus on technological dominance—demonstrated in its leadership in 5G technology and artificial intelligence 
(AI)—positions it as a formidable rival in key strategic sectors, potentially diminishing the U.S.’s technological 
edge. 

Another critical constraint is economic strain within the United States itself. The U.S. national debt surpassed 
$31 trillion in recent years, putting immense pressure on domestic spending and reducing its capacity for 
foreign interventions. Economic inequality, as noted by Thomas Piketty in Capital in the Twenty-First Century 
(2013), has also become a domestic concern, undermining social cohesion and potentially eroding the 
resources needed to maintain global commitments. Economic vulnerabilities were further highlighted by the 
2008 financial crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic, both of which impacted U.S. economic stability and exposed 
the limits of its economic resilience. 

Ideologically, the U.S. also faces challenges to its soft power. American ideals of democracy and human rights, 
which have long been pillars of its global influence, are increasingly questioned both at home and abroad. The 
resurgence of right-wing populism, racial tensions, and the erosion of democratic norms have damaged

America’s moral authority. Scholars like Francis Fukuyama, who famously predicted the "end of history" with 
the global spread of democracy, now recognize that democratic backsliding within the U.S. could weaken its 
appeal as a model for governance. 

In the future, economic and technological competition from China and internal ideological divisions are likely 
to become more prominent constraints on American hegemony. As multipolarity strengthens and new powers 
like India and the European Union assert their influence, American dominance may continue to be challenged 
in both traditional and emerging spheres of power. These dynamics suggest a gradual shift from a unipolar 
world led by the U.S. to a more complex, multipolar system. 

 
Q.3) Critically examine the rise of People’s Republic of China (PRC) as a great power and its implications on 

Asian Political order. (2022) (20 Marks) 
 

Approach to write the answer 

 
Introduction:  
• Introduce China’s rise as a great power reshaping Asia’s political and security order. 
Body:  
• Discuss China’s economic growth, military expansion, and influence on regional alliances, including 

concerns over dependency and tensions. 
Conclusion:  
• Conclude by highlighting how China’s rise signals a shift toward a multipolar Asia with evolving power 

dynamics. 
 
The rise of the People’s Republic of China (PRC) as a great power has significantly reshaped the Asian political 
order, challenging both regional and global dynamics. Since initiating economic reforms in 1978 under Deng 
Xiaoping, China has transformed into the world’s second-largest economy and a major military power, gaining 
influence over Asia’s political, economic, and security landscape. Scholars such as John Mearsheimer argue 
that China’s rise exemplifies the “offensive realism” model, where great powers seek regional dominance, 
while others, like Joseph Nye, assert that China’s strategy also involves “soft power” elements, focusing on 
economic and cultural influence alongside military capability. 

China's economic growth has been a driving force behind its geopolitical influence. With an average GDP 
growth rate exceeding 9% for several decades, China has become a central economic partner for many Asian 
countries. Through initiatives like the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), China has invested over $1 trillion in 
infrastructure projects across Asia, creating economic dependencies and strengthening political ties. In 
countries like Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and Cambodia, Chinese investments have created deep strategic 
partnerships that increase Beijing’s influence over regional affairs. However, critics argue that this economic 
expansion fosters a “debt-trap diplomacy,” as highlighted by the cases of Sri Lanka’s Hambantota port, where 
unsustainable debt led to a long-term Chinese lease on the port, raising concerns over sovereignty and control. 

China’s military expansion has also shifted the Asian security environment. The modernization of the People’s 
Liberation Army (PLA), combined with the establishment of military bases in the South China Sea, has 
reinforced China’s strategic ambitions. According to data from the Stockholm International Peace Research 
Institute (SIPRI), China’s defense budget is the second-largest globally, reflecting its commitment to becoming

a military counterbalance to the United States. The PRC’s assertiveness in territorial disputes, particularly with 
India, Japan, and Southeast Asian nations, has heightened tensions and led to a regional arms race, compelling 
countries like Japan and India to enhance their own defense capabilities and seek closer ties with the U.S. as 
a counterbalance. 

Moreover, China’s rise has implications for regional multilateralism. While it participates in organizations like 
the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), China 
often promotes a regional order aligned with its interests, challenging the post-World War II liberal order. Its 
promotion of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), an Asia-Pacific trade agreement 
excluding the U.S., reflects China’s vision of a multipolar Asia where it has a central role. 

China’s ascent as a great power has redefined the Asian political order by challenging the influence of 
traditional powers and reshaping regional alliances. While its economic and military strategies enhance its 
standing, they also create regional tensions and dependencies. The PRC’s rise signals a shift toward a 
multipolar Asia, where the balance of power continues to evolve amid competing interests and alignments. 

 
Q.4) Critically examine the decline of the United States of America as a hegemon and its implications for the 

changing international political order. (2021) (15 Marks) 
 

Approach to write the answer 

 
Introduction:  
• Introduce the debate on the decline of U.S. hegemony and its impact on global power dynamics. 
Body:  
• Discuss factors such as China’s economic rise, U.S. military overreach, and domestic political 

polarization weakening U.S. global influence. 
Conclusion:  
• Highlight the transition towards a multipolar world, with implications for global stability and the need 

for new multilateral approaches. 
 
The decline of the United States as a global hegemon has been a topic of considerable debate in international 
relations, marked by shifts in economic, military, and geopolitical influence. Traditionally, U.S. hegemony was 
characterized by its unparalleled economic power, military dominance, and cultural influence, particularly 
following World War II and the end of the Cold War, which positioned the U.S. as the world’s leading 
superpower. However, a range of factors, from economic challenges to changing global dynamics, has led 
scholars and policymakers to question the sustainability of U.S. dominance and its implications for the 
international political order. 

One major factor in the decline of U.S. hegemony is the relative shift in economic power towards emerging 
economies, particularly China. As economist Joseph Nye notes in The Future of Power, while the U.S. continues 
to be an economic powerhouse, China's rapid growth, technological advancements, and assertive foreign 
policy have made it a formidable rival. China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), its increasing influence in Africa 
and Latin America, and its expanding military capabilities challenge U.S. economic and strategic dominance. 
Data from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) shows that China’s GDP in purchasing power parity (PPP)

terms has surpassed that of the U.S., indicating a shifting balance of economic power that has reshaped global 
alignments. 

Another factor contributing to the U.S. decline is the protracted military engagements in the Middle East and 
Afghanistan, which have not only drained American resources but also diminished its credibility as a global 
leader. The U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021, following two decades of military intervention, raised 
questions about U.S. commitment and capability to shape global affairs. Scholars like Stephen Walt argue that 
the costs of maintaining a large military presence globally, without clear strategic outcomes, have eroded both 
the U.S. economic base and its soft power appeal. 

Furthermore, domestic political polarization has weakened the coherence of U.S. foreign policy. The divisive 
nature of American politics, particularly visible during the Trump administration, which saw a retreat from 
multilateralism and international agreements, has led allies and rivals alike to question the stability of U.S. 
leadership. This uncertainty has allowed other powers, like the European Union, China, and Russia, to assert 
their influence in multilateral institutions. 

The decline of U.S. hegemony has profound implications for the international political order. As power 
becomes more diffused, a multipolar world seems to be emerging, where regional powers such as China, 
Russia, and the EU play larger roles. John Mearsheimer suggests in The Tragedy of Great Power Politics that a 
multipolar world is inherently less stable, with increased risks of conflict due to power competition. 
Additionally, as U.S. influence wanes, emerging powers may prioritize national interests over collective 
security, challenging established norms and global governance structures. 

The decline of U.S. hegemony signals a shift towards a multipolar world order, with significant implications for 
global stability and governance. This transition may lead to increased competition and instability, as emerging 
powers assert their interests in the absence of a single, stabilizing superpower. The evolving landscape calls 
for new approaches to multilateralism and international cooperation to manage the changing dynamics of 
global power.

The strategic rivalry between China and the United States has significant implications for South and Southeast 
Asia, reshaping economic, political, and security dynamics in the region. This rivalry is rooted in the contest 
for influence, as China seeks to expand its regional dominance through initiatives like the Belt and Road 
Initiative (BRI) while the United States aims to counterbalance China’s rise through its Indo-Pacific strategy. 
The implications of this rivalry for South and Southeast Asia are both opportunities and challenges, affecting 
economic integration, security architecture, and regional autonomy. 

One major implication of Sino-American rivalry is the intensification of economic competition in the region. 
China’s BRI has led to substantial investments in infrastructure projects across South and Southeast Asia, 
enhancing connectivity but also increasing debt dependency on China. Countries like Sri Lanka, Pakistan, and 
Myanmar have welcomed Chinese investments but are wary of the "debt trap diplomacy" often associated 
with BRI, as seen in Sri Lanka's Hambantota Port lease to China. The United States has countered with 
initiatives such as the Blue Dot Network and the BUILD Act, which aim to provide sustainable infrastructure 
investment alternatives, though these initiatives lack the scale of the BRI. This economic competition offers 
regional countries greater access to funding but also pressures them to align with one of the two powers, 
potentially compromising their autonomy. 

In terms of security implications, the Sino-American rivalry has increased militarization in South and Southeast 
Asia. The U.S. has strengthened security partnerships with countries like India, Japan, and Australia, 
formalizing the Quad (Quadrilateral Security Dialogue) to counterbalance China’s military assertiveness in the 
Indo-Pacific region. India, for instance, has deepened defense cooperation with the U.S. through agreements 
such as the Logistics Exchange Memorandum of Agreement (LEMOA) and the Communications Compatibility 
and Security Agreement (COMCASA). Conversely, China has increased its naval presence in the South China 
Sea, creating security concerns among Southeast Asian nations like Vietnam and the Philippines. This military 
build-up raises the risk of conflicts, such as the territorial disputes in the South China Sea, which could 
destabilize the region. 

Politically, the Sino-American rivalry challenges the regional autonomy of South and Southeast Asian nations. 
Smaller countries like Laos, Cambodia, and the Maldives often face pressures to align with China due to 
economic dependency, while others, such as Vietnam and the Philippines, look to the U.S. as a counterweight 
to Chinese influence. This has led to a fragmentation within the Association of Southeast Asian Nations 
(ASEAN), with member states divided in their approach to China. Scholar Evelyn Goh argues that the region’s 
traditional "hedging" strategy—seeking benefits from both China and the U.S. while avoiding alignment—has 
become increasingly difficult due to the intensifying rivalry. 

The rivalry also impacts regional trade dynamics. The U.S.-China trade war has disrupted global supply chains, 
pushing companies to relocate production from China to South and Southeast Asia, benefiting countries like 
Vietnam, Thailand, and Bangladesh. However, this shift also creates economic vulnerabilities, as these nations 
must navigate potential tariffs and trade restrictions imposed by either superpower, limiting their growth 
prospects. 

The Sino-American strategic rivalry has brought both opportunities and challenges to South and Southeast 
Asia. While it provides access to investment and strategic partnerships, it also raises security tensions, 
threatens regional autonomy, and disrupts trade. The region’s future stability hinges on its ability to maintain 
a balanced approach, maximizing the benefits of engagement with both powers without succumbing to the 
pressures of alignment, thus preserving its strategic independence.

Q.6) Discuss the consequences of Trump’s ‘America first’ and Xi Jinping’s ‘Chinese dream’ on world politics. 

(2018) (15 Marks) 
 

Approach to write the answer 

 
Introduction:  
• Introduce how "America First" and the "Chinese Dream" reflect assertive nationalist visions reshaping 

global politics. 
Body:  
• Discuss the impact of "America First" on U.S. alliances and multilateralism, and the "Chinese Dream" on 

China's global expansion and regional tensions. 
Conclusion:  
• Highlight how these doctrines have intensified U.S.-China rivalry, weakened multilateralism, and 

fragmented the international order. 
 
The "America First" policy of former U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping’s "Chinese 
Dream" both represent assertive nationalistic visions that have reshaped global politics, often leading to 
increased tension and rivalry in international relations. "America First" focused on reasserting U.S. interests, 
reducing dependence on multilateral institutions, and prioritizing economic nationalism, while the "Chinese 
Dream" aims for national rejuvenation, emphasizing China’s rise as a global power and restoring its historical 
position of influence. Together, these doctrines have fueled an era of competition, altering alliances, trade 
dynamics, and the international order. 

Trump’s "America First" agenda sought to reduce U.S. involvement in global commitments, focusing instead 
on domestic issues and bilateral over multilateral approaches. Trump criticized institutions like NATO, 
withdrew from international agreements like the Paris Climate Accord, and pursued trade wars, notably 
against China. According to John Mearsheimer’s realist perspective in The Tragedy of Great Power Politics 
(2001), Trump’s focus on protecting U.S. economic interests over international commitments reflects a realist 
approach to securing power in an anarchic international system. This pivot strained U.S. relations with 
traditional allies in Europe and Asia, causing countries like Germany and Japan to consider more independent 
security and economic policies. 

Meanwhile, Xi Jinping’s "Chinese Dream" of national rejuvenation emphasizes China’s ambition to be a major 
global player, with a particular focus on expanding its influence across Asia, Africa, and beyond through the 
Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). By investing in infrastructure projects across continents, China has solidified its 
role as a key partner for developing countries, challenging the economic influence of the West. David 
Shambaugh, in China Goes Global (2013), notes that this expansion is part of China’s broader strategy to build 
a Sino-centric order. The Chinese Dream’s emphasis on territorial integrity and national pride, particularly in 
regions like Taiwan and the South China Sea, has also heightened regional tensions, leading to strategic 
concerns among neighboring countries and the U.S. 

Together, "America First" and the "Chinese Dream" have intensified a competitive dynamic between the U.S. 
and China, leading to what many analysts call a "new Cold War." The trade conflict between the two powers 
disrupted global supply chains, affecting economies worldwide, while their rivalry has fueled an arms race in

the Indo-Pacific, with countries like India, Australia, and Japan forming alliances under initiatives like the Quad 
to balance China’s influence. Additionally, these doctrines have weakened multilateralism, as both countries 
have pursued unilateral or selective multilateral approaches, leaving gaps in global governance, from climate 
change to trade. 

Trump’s "America First" and Xi Jinping’s "Chinese Dream" have reshaped world politics by intensifying U.S.-
China rivalry, weakening alliances, and eroding multilateralism. This shift has created a more fragmented 
international order, pushing countries to adapt to the changing power dynamics and a more polarized global 
landscape. 

 
Q.7) Examine in brief the rise and fall of the Cold War. (2016) (15 Marks) 

 
Approach to write the answer 

 
Introduction:  
• Introduce the Cold War as an ideological and geopolitical rivalry between the U.S. and the Soviet Union, 

shaping global politics from 1945 to 1991. 
Body:  
• Outline key events such as containment policies, crises, arms races, and détente efforts, highlighting 

mutual distrust and ideological competition. 
Conclusion:  
• Conclude by noting the Cold War's end, its impact on global politics, and its lasting influence on current 

international relations. 
 
The Cold War, a period of ideological and geopolitical rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union, 
defined global politics from the end of World War II in 1945 until the Soviet Union’s collapse in 1991. Emerging 
out of conflicting visions for the post-war world, the Cold War was characterized by mutual distrust, nuclear 
arms races, and proxy conflicts across the globe. Historians like John Lewis Gaddis have argued that the Cold 
War was a "long peace" in terms of direct military conflict between the superpowers but marked by persistent 
ideological tensions and localized wars. 

The rise of the Cold War can be traced to the immediate post-World War II period, as both superpowers sought 
to expand their influence. The Yalta Conference (1945) initially promised cooperation, but ideological 
differences soon led to tensions. The U.S. adopted a policy of containment as outlined in George Kennan’s 
Long Telegram (1946), aiming to prevent the spread of communism. This policy led to the Truman Doctrine in 
1947, pledging support to countries resisting communist influence, and the Marshall Plan, which provided 
economic assistance to Western Europe to counter Soviet influence. The Soviet Union, under Joseph Stalin, 
consolidated its power over Eastern Europe, creating a buffer of socialist states and further entrenching the 
ideological divide. Winston Churchill famously described this divide as the “Iron Curtain”, a term symbolizing 
the deepening division between East and West. 

The Cold War’s peak was marked by intense rivalries and crises, including the Berlin Blockade (1948-49), the 
Korean War (1950-53), and the Cuban Missile Crisis (1962), which brought the world to the brink of nuclear 
war. Both superpowers engaged in an arms race and competed for influence in newly independent nations in 
Asia, Africa, and Latin America. The Cold War also saw the formation of military alliances, namely NATO in the

West and the Warsaw Pact in the East. Henry Kissinger, in his work Diplomacy, argued that the Cold War rivalry 
was a result of mutual fear and mistrust, exacerbated by nuclear brinkmanship and competing visions of global 
order. 

However, by the 1970s, both superpowers began exploring détente, or a relaxation of tensions, motivated by 
the economic burdens of military competition and the threat of nuclear annihilation. The Strategic Arms 
Limitation Talks (SALT) and the Helsinki Accords of 1975 exemplified attempts at stabilizing the relationship. 
But détente was short-lived, and tensions resurfaced with the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979, which 
led the U.S. to adopt a more aggressive stance under President Ronald Reagan. 

The Cold War eventually declined due to a combination of economic challenges within the Soviet Union, 
growing demands for political reform, and the visionary leadership of Mikhail Gorbachev. Gorbachev’s policies 
of glasnost (openness) and perestroika (restructuring) were attempts to reform the Soviet system but 
inadvertently weakened the state’s grip. The fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 symbolized the collapse of the 
Soviet bloc, and by 1991, the Soviet Union itself dissolved, marking the definitive end of the Cold War. 

The Cold War was a complex ideological and geopolitical struggle that rose from the ashes of World War II and 
shaped global politics for nearly half a century. Its end marked a significant shift toward unipolarity and the 
spread of liberal democracy, but the legacy of the Cold War continues to influence international relations 
today, particularly in U.S.-Russia relations. 

 
Q.8) Discuss the positive and negative impacts of Soviet Union’s disintegration on developing nations. (2016)

Introduction:  
• Introduce the mixed impacts of the Soviet Union's disintegration on developing nations, altering global 

power dynamics. 
Body:  
• Discuss positive outcomes like increased autonomy and economic reforms, alongside negative effects 

such as economic instability and regional conflicts. 
Conclusion:  
• Highlight the dual nature of the Soviet collapse's impact, offering both opportunities and challenges for 

developing nations in the post-Cold War world. 
 
The disintegration of the Soviet Union in 1991 had profound and mixed impacts on developing nations, altering 
their political, economic, and strategic landscapes. The event marked the end of the Cold War and drastically 
changed the global power balance, leading to both positive and negative consequences for the developing 
world. 

On the positive side, the collapse of the Soviet Union reduced the intense ideological divide between 
capitalism and socialism that had polarized international relations during the Cold War. With the end of 
superpower rivalry, developing nations gained greater autonomy in shaping their foreign and domestic 
policies without pressure to align with either the U.S. or the Soviet bloc. This newfound freedom allowed many

countries to pursue independent paths to development. In addition, the post-Cold War era saw a surge in 
economic liberalization across Asia, Africa, and Latin America, where countries like India implemented 
significant economic reforms in 1991, opening their economies to foreign investment and adopting more 
market-friendly policies. This shift aligned with a global wave of liberalization, which some scholars argue 
helped developing nations achieve higher growth rates by integrating into the global economy. 

The end of Soviet support also compelled many developing nations to pursue internal economic restructuring, 
enhancing self-reliance and economic pragmatism. In Africa, for instance, countries that had depended on 
Soviet aid and ideological backing, such as Angola and Ethiopia, transitioned towards multiparty democracies 
and embraced market reforms. Scholar Jeffrey Sachs, in his work The End of Poverty, discusses how the 
reduced ideological rigidity of the post-Cold War era allowed developing countries to adopt mixed economic 
models suited to their specific needs. 

However, the disintegration of the Soviet Union also had negative impacts on developing nations, especially 
those that had relied heavily on Soviet aid, military support, and ideological solidarity. Without Soviet backing, 
countries like Cuba, Vietnam, and North Korea faced economic hardships, as they were left without a key ally 
in their socialist economic policies. Cuba, for instance, entered the “Special Period” after the Soviet collapse, 
experiencing severe shortages and economic instability due to the loss of Soviet trade and subsidies. 
Additionally, the vacuum left by the Soviet Union allowed the U.S. to expand its influence globally, leading to 
unipolar dominance. This shift gave the U.S. greater leverage to push for neoliberal economic policies in 
developing nations, often through institutions like the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank. 
Critics argue that these policies, which focused on austerity and structural adjustments, sometimes hindered 
growth and deepened inequality in the developing world. 

Furthermore, the dissolution of the Soviet Union led to the fragmentation of regional conflicts that had been 
contained by Cold War dynamics. In the absence of Soviet support, internal conflicts and civil wars emerged 
or intensified in regions like Africa and Eastern Europe. For instance, the Rwandan Genocide and the Yugoslav 
Wars in the 1990s demonstrated the destabilizing effects of the post-Cold War power vacuum. 

While the disintegration of the Soviet Union provided developing nations with more autonomy and 
opportunities for economic reform, it also brought significant challenges, including economic instability, the 
imposition of neoliberal policies, and the exacerbation of regional conflicts. The impact of this major 
geopolitical shift remains mixed, with both positive transformations and difficult adjustments shaping the path 
of developing nations in the post-Cold War world.

Conclusion:  
• Summarize the lasting impacts on global politics, including NATO expansion, regional instability, and 

economic shifts. 
 
The collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 marked a turning point in global history, ending the Cold War and 
profoundly reshaping international politics. This disintegration resulted from a combination of economic 
struggles, political reforms, and social movements. Mikhail Gorbachev’s policies of glasnost (openness) and 
perestroika (restructuring) were initially intended to reform the Soviet system but instead accelerated its 
collapse. The economic stagnation in the Soviet Union, along with an unsustainable arms race with the United 
States, placed immense pressure on the Soviet economy, leading to internal dissatisfaction. Additionally, the 
rise of nationalist movements in Soviet republics like Lithuania, Ukraine, and the Baltic states further 
weakened the union. By December 1991, the USSR formally dissolved, with Russia and other former republics 
declaring independence. 

The collapse of the Soviet Union had profound effects on international politics, leading to the end of the 
bipolar world order and the emergence of a unipolar system dominated by the United States. Political scientist 
Francis Fukuyama famously declared this shift as the "end of history," arguing that liberal democracy and 
capitalism had triumphed over communism as the ultimate form of government. In practice, the U.S. emerged 
as the world's superpower, with NATO expanding eastward and the European Union incorporating former 
Soviet states and Eastern European countries. This expansion of Western influence into the former Soviet 
sphere is evident in the Baltic states’ membership in NATO and the EU, reshaping the security landscape in 
Europe. 

Another significant impact was the rise of ethnic conflicts and instability within the post-Soviet space. The 
sudden disintegration of Soviet control created a vacuum, leading to conflicts in regions like Chechnya, 
Nagorno-Karabakh, and Moldova’s Transnistria. This instability highlighted the challenges of state-building and 
identity in newly independent republics. Russia, under leaders like Vladimir Putin, has since sought to reassert 
its influence in these regions, leading to confrontations with Western countries, such as the annexation of 
Crimea in 2014 and ongoing tensions in Ukraine. 

The collapse of the Soviet Union also led to the spread of neoliberal economic policies, often promoted by 
institutions like the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank. The "shock therapy" approach 
implemented in Russia and Eastern Europe aimed to transition economies from state control to market 
capitalism rapidly. However, as noted by economist Joseph Stiglitz in Globalization and Its Discontents (2002), 
this approach led to severe economic hardships, widespread poverty, and the rise of oligarchs, which further 
complicated Russia’s integration into the global economy. 

The Soviet Union's collapse significantly impacted international politics by ending the Cold War and 
establishing a U.S.-dominated unipolar world. This shift resulted in NATO's expansion, regional conflicts in the 
former Soviet states, and economic transformations that continue to shape global politics today. The legacy 
of the Soviet collapse is still evident in the geopolitical tensions and economic policies that define current 
international relations.

Introduction:  
• Introduce Mr. "X" (George Kennan) and his influential 1947 article on the U.S. Cold War containment 

policy. 
Body:  
• Discuss Kennan’s advocacy for a strategic, non-military containment approach, focusing on political, 

economic, and diplomatic tactics to counter Soviet expansion. 
Conclusion:  
• Highlight the lasting impact of Kennan’s containment strategy on U.S. foreign policy, emphasizing its 

emphasis on patience and alliances. 
 
Mr. "X" was the pseudonym used by George F. Kennan, an American diplomat and historian, in his influential 
1947 article, The Sources of Soviet Conduct, published in Foreign Affairs. Kennan’s analysis became a 
foundational document for the U.S. policy of containment during the Cold War, shaping American foreign 
policy toward the Soviet Union. Kennan argued that the Soviet Union, driven by a Marxist-Leninist ideology 
and a need for security, was inherently expansionist. His approach recommended that the U.S. counter Soviet 
influence not through direct confrontation but through a calculated and patient containment strategy that 
would prevent the spread of communism while avoiding a full-scale war. 

Kennan’s approach emphasized the importance of "political warfare," a mix of diplomatic, economic, and 
psychological tactics aimed at limiting Soviet influence without immediate military engagement. Kennan 
wrote, “The main element of any United States policy toward the Soviet Union must be that of a long-term, 
patient but firm and vigilant containment of Russian expansive tendencies.” This strategy was rooted in the 
belief that the Soviet Union would eventually weaken from within due to its systemic flaws and ideological 
rigidity. Rather than advocating direct military intervention, Kennan promoted a nuanced approach, 
encouraging alliances and bolstering the political stability of vulnerable regions. 

His ideas became institutionalized in policies like the Truman Doctrine, which pledged support for countries 
resisting communism, and the Marshall Plan, an economic aid initiative to rebuild Western Europe and 
strengthen its defenses against Soviet influence. The containment strategy guided U.S. actions during key Cold 
War crises, such as the Berlin Blockade, the Korean War, and later, the Cuban Missile Crisis. 

Kennan’s approach, however, had its critics and evolved over time. He grew disillusioned with the more 
militarized interpretation of containment that emerged in the 1950s, particularly under policies such as NSC-
68, which advocated for the expansion of U.S. military capabilities. Kennan believed that an excessive focus 
on military confrontation would entrench the Cold War rather than strategically manage it. Later in life, he 
advocated for a more diplomatic approach, emphasizing restraint and negotiation. 

In sum, Mr. “X,” or George Kennan, pioneered the strategy of containment, advocating for a balanced, non-
military approach to managing the Soviet threat. His work laid the foundation for decades of U.S. foreign policy 
and underscored the importance of strategic patience, alliances, and economic influence in global politics.

Introduction:  
• Introduce the evolution of American hegemony from the unipolar moment after the Soviet collapse to 

challenges in the modern multipolar world. 
Body:  
• Discuss key challenges like China's rise, Russia's resurgence, regional organizations’ influence, and 

declining U.S. soft power. 
Conclusion:  
• Highlight the ongoing shift toward multipolarity, complicating U.S. dominance in global affairs. 

 
American hegemony in the post-Soviet world has faced numerous challenges, evolving from the unipolar 
moment of the early 1990s to an increasingly multipolar global structure. Initially, the fall of the Soviet Union 
in 1991 positioned the United States as the world’s undisputed superpower, leading to what Charles 
Krauthammer termed the “unipolar moment.” However, over the past three decades, various political, 
economic, and military factors have posed significant challenges to U.S. dominance. 

One major challenge to American hegemony is the rise of China as a global economic and military power. 
Scholar Fareed Zakaria, in The Post-American World (2008), refers to this shift as the “rise of the rest,” 
highlighting how countries like China have rapidly expanded their influence. China’s Belt and Road Initiative 
(BRI) exemplifies its growing global presence, as it seeks to establish trade networks and infrastructure 
investment worldwide, thereby challenging U.S. influence in Asia, Africa, and Europe. Additionally, China’s 
increased military assertiveness in the South China Sea has become a focal point of U.S.-China tensions, posing 
a direct challenge to American influence in the Asia-Pacific. 

Russia’s resurgence under Vladimir Putin also represents a challenge to U.S. hegemony, especially through its 
assertive foreign policy in Eastern Europe and the Middle East. Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014 and its 
military intervention in Syria reflect an intent to reassert its regional influence, countering U.S. and NATO 
interests. John Mearsheimer, a prominent realist scholar, argued in The Tragedy of Great Power Politics (2001) 
that great powers naturally seek to maximize their influence, and Russia’s actions are a manifestation of this 
realist principle, especially in the post-Cold War security environment. 

Another challenge comes from the increasing influence of regional organizations and multilateral institutions 
that sometimes act independently of U.S. interests. The European Union (EU) has emerged as an economic 
powerhouse, occasionally diverging from American foreign policy, as seen in its approach to climate change 
and trade. Additionally, multilateral forums like the BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) 
challenge Western-dominated financial institutions such as the World Bank and IMF, advocating for a 
multipolar economic order. 

Lastly, the spread of anti-American sentiment, especially in the Middle East following interventions in Iraq and 
Afghanistan, has damaged the United States’ global image and soft power. Joseph Nye argues that “soft 
power” is crucial to maintaining hegemony, but events like the 2003 Iraq invasion have eroded America’s 
moral authority, fostering resistance to its leadership.

While the United States remains a powerful global actor, its hegemony is challenged by the rise of China, 
Russia’s assertiveness, the influence of regional organizations, and declining soft power. These dynamics 
indicate a shift towards a multipolar world, complicating the U.S.’s role as the dominant global power. 

 
Q.12) "During the Cold War, the Non-Aligned Movement tried to become a 'Third force' in World Politics, but 

failed because it was too large and unwieldy. " Discuss. (2023) (20 Marks) 
 

Approach to write the answer 

 
Introduction:  
• Introduce NAM as a Cold War-era movement advocating a "Third Force" alternative to U.S. and Soviet 

dominance. 
Body:  
• Discuss NAM’s growth, internal divisions, and structural limitations, highlighting challenges like 

conflicting interests and limited resources. 
Conclusion:  
• Summarize NAM's achievements and limitations, emphasizing how internal divisions and Cold War 

pressures hindered its cohesion as a third force. 
 
The Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) emerged during the Cold War as an alternative to the bipolar power 
structure dominated by the United States and the Soviet Union, aiming to become a "Third Force" in world 
politics. Leaders like Jawaharlal Nehru, Josip Broz Tito, and Gamal Abdel Nasser envisioned NAM as a coalition 
of newly independent nations that would resist alignment with either superpower, instead promoting peace, 
independence, and development. Scholar Peter Willetts describes NAM’s foundational principle as a “third 
path” where countries could assert their sovereignty and address issues unique to the developing world 
without Cold War interference. 

NAM’s mission resonated globally, leading to rapid expansion, and by the 1970s, it included over 100 countries 
from Asia, Africa, and Latin America. However, this growth contributed to its challenges, as its large, diverse 
membership made consensus-building difficult. As historian Odd Arne Westad argues in The Global Cold War 
(2007), NAM’s diversity of political ideologies, economic needs, and foreign policy orientations made it difficult 
to present a cohesive policy stance, thus undermining its effectiveness. For instance, while some members, 
like India and Egypt, advocated neutrality, others like Cuba and Algeria leaned toward the Soviet bloc for 
economic or military support, creating internal divisions. 

The structural limitations of NAM also weakened its ability to operate as a unified "Third Force." Its decision-
making processes were often bogged down by conflicting interests, particularly on issues such as colonial 
liberation and economic development. At the 1979 Havana Conference, these tensions were stark, with Cuba's 
Fidel Castro pushing for a more anti-Western stance that alienated several member states preferring 
neutrality. Such divergence diluted NAM's position and limited its influence, particularly in mediating Cold War 
conflicts. 

Further, NAM's focus on ideals rather than pragmatic strategies limited its impact. Unlike the U.S. and Soviet 
alliances, NAM lacked a robust economic or military mechanism, which reduced its ability to project influence 
or provide security guarantees to its members. Scholar Mohammed Ayoob points out that NAM’s lack of

material resources and strategic power made it reliant on diplomatic influence, which was insufficient to 
counterbalance the superpowers. 

While NAM had significant achievements, such as supporting decolonization and advocating for economic 
justice through the New International Economic Order (NIEO) proposal, it ultimately failed to become a 
cohesive third force. Its size and diversity, combined with limited resources, hindered its ability to act 
decisively on global issues, especially as members often diverged on key political alignments. In conclusion, 
although NAM offered an important platform for the Global South, its ambition to be a "Third Force" was 
undermined by internal divisions and the realities of Cold War geopolitics. 

 
Q.13) Discuss the ways to strengthen the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) to enable it to address the challenges 

faced by the developing countries. (2020) (20 Marks) 
 

Approach to write the answer 

 
Introduction:  
• Introduce the need to strengthen NAM to address contemporary issues like economic inequality, 

climate change, and digital inequality. 
Body:  
• Discuss specific approaches, including economic cooperation, environmental action, digital inclusivity, 

and enhanced diplomatic influence. 
Conclusion:  
• Emphasize the potential of a revitalized NAM to champion a fairer global order, representing the 

interests of the Global South. 
 
Strengthening the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) is essential for enabling it to address the contemporary 
challenges faced by developing countries, such as economic inequality, climate change, geopolitical tensions, 
and digital inequality. Originally founded during the Cold War to provide a neutral platform for nations that 
sought to remain independent of both the U.S. and Soviet blocs, NAM now comprises 120 countries but has 
struggled to maintain relevance in a multipolar world. To revitalize NAM, a multi-pronged approach focusing 
on economic cooperation, environmental action, technological advancement, and diplomatic unity is crucial. 

First, enhancing economic cooperation among NAM members can foster collective self-reliance. By creating a 
structured economic alliance, similar to the South-South cooperation initiatives, NAM can promote trade, 
investment, and shared development projects within its member states. Scholars like Vijay Prashad emphasize 
that NAM could offer an alternative economic model to the neoliberal frameworks often imposed by 
international financial institutions. For example, NAM could establish a common fund or development bank 
to support member states in developing critical infrastructure, reducing dependence on Western-dominated 
institutions like the IMF and World Bank. 

Environmental action is another area where NAM can have a significant impact. Many NAM countries are 
vulnerable to climate change and are often disproportionately affected by extreme weather events and rising 
sea levels. By forming a collective voice in international climate negotiations, NAM could push for greater 
financial and technical support from developed countries, as mandated in the Paris Agreement. A coordinated

NAM stance on climate issues could help secure commitments on climate financing and technology transfer, 
ensuring that developing nations receive adequate resources for adaptation and resilience. 

Addressing the digital divide is also critical for strengthening NAM. With rapid technological advancements, 
developing countries face the risk of being left behind in areas like artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, and 
digital infrastructure. NAM could establish a technology-sharing framework among its members, focusing on 
capacity building, digital literacy, and the protection of data sovereignty. For instance, NAM could collaborate 
with initiatives like India’s Digital India program to enhance digital inclusivity across member states, thereby 
empowering them to participate in the global digital economy. 

Finally, NAM must reassert its diplomatic influence by adapting to current geopolitical dynamics. In a 
multipolar world, NAM can offer a platform for dialogue among major powers, serving as a mediator and a 
voice for peace. As seen in recent years, with the intensifying U.S.-China rivalry, NAM could work to prevent 
smaller states from being drawn into geopolitical conflicts. A unified NAM can advocate for reforms in global 
governance, including increased representation of developing countries in the UN Security Council, to ensure 
a fairer international system. 

By fostering economic cooperation, advocating environmental and digital inclusivity, and enhancing its 
diplomatic role, NAM can effectively address the challenges facing developing countries. Revitalizing NAM 
requires commitment from member states to reinforce solidarity and advocate for a fairer and more equitable 
global order. This renewed NAM could serve as a robust platform for the voices and interests of the Global 
South in a complex and interconnected world.

One of the key outcomes of the 17th NAM Summit was the emphasis on protecting sovereignty and non-
interference in domestic affairs, especially in response to U.S. and Western interventions. Venezuelan 
President Nicolás Maduro, the host of the summit, urged NAM member states to resist foreign interference, 
citing Venezuela’s own experiences of economic sanctions and political pressure from the West. This anti-
imperialist stance highlighted NAM’s traditional role as a platform for developing countries to collectively 
resist political domination by powerful nations. Leaders reiterated support for Venezuela’s sovereignty, and 
the summit served as a show of solidarity against Western policies perceived as infringing on national 
autonomy. 

The summit also addressed economic development and South-South cooperation as a strategy for member 
states to achieve sustainable development. Amidst growing economic crises in some NAM countries, the 
summit encouraged increased economic partnerships and technology-sharing among developing nations. 
Scholars argue that South-South cooperation is essential for reducing dependency on Western powers and 
achieving balanced development. NAM leaders discussed the importance of achieving the United Nations’ 
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) through mutual assistance and collective economic strategies, 
demonstrating NAM’s relevance in global economic discussions. 

In addition to economic and political concerns, the 17th NAM Summit emphasized the need for peace and 
stability, especially in conflict-ridden regions within the NAM bloc. Leaders expressed concerns over ongoing 
conflicts in the Middle East, such as Syria and Yemen, and reiterated NAM’s commitment to peaceful conflict 
resolution and respect for international law. The summit issued the Margarita Declaration, which called for a 
just and equitable world order, denouncing terrorism and promoting peace through diplomatic solutions. 

The 17th NAM Summit in Venezuela underscored NAM’s continued role as a voice for the Global South, 
emphasizing sovereignty, economic independence, and peace. By focusing on solidarity against foreign 
intervention, economic cooperation, and stability, NAM reaffirmed its principles while adapting to 
contemporary challenges, reinforcing its relevance for developing nations in a rapidly changing global 
landscape.

The Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) is a significant contribution of the non-Western world to global politics, 
representing an effort by newly independent states to assert their sovereignty and autonomy during the Cold 
War. Formed in 1961 under the leadership of leaders like Jawaharlal Nehru of India, Josip Broz Tito of 
Yugoslavia, Gamal Abdel Nasser of Egypt, Kwame Nkrumah of Ghana, and Sukarno of Indonesia, NAM aimed 
to offer an alternative to the bipolar Cold War framework dominated by the U.S. and the Soviet Union. The 
movement's primary principle was non-alignment, allowing member states to avoid formal alliances with 
either superpower, maintain independent foreign policies, and advocate for peace, self-determination, and 
economic justice. 

NAM’s significance lies in its emphasis on sovereignty, self-determination, and development. Unlike Western 
or Soviet approaches, which often sought influence or control over newly decolonized countries, NAM 
advocated for respect for territorial integrity and non-interference in internal affairs. The movement’s 
foundational principles, established at the Bandung Conference in 1955, focused on resisting colonialism, 
imperialism, and racial discrimination, giving a voice to post-colonial countries seeking recognition in world 
politics. According to Robert J. C. Young in Postcolonialism: An Historical Introduction (2001), NAM allowed 
nations emerging from colonialism to reject the pressures of aligning with global powers, creating a “third 
way” that emphasized global solidarity and justice. 

One of NAM’s notable contributions was its role in advocating for a New International Economic Order (NIEO) 
in the 1970s. This proposal aimed to address the economic inequalities between developed and developing 
countries, promoting fairer terms in international trade, greater control over natural resources, and better 
economic conditions for developing nations. Although the NIEO faced opposition from Western countries, it 
underscored NAM’s commitment to restructuring the global economic system to benefit poorer nations, a 
move that resonated with other developing countries and strengthened South-South cooperation. 

NAM’s influence can be seen in contemporary international politics, especially within the United Nations, 
where non-aligned countries often coordinate to advocate for disarmament, climate change action, and 
sustainable development. Despite criticisms of losing relevance post-Cold War, NAM remains a unique 
platform for countries to collectively voice their concerns and uphold an independent foreign policy stance. 
For instance, during the 2003 Iraq War, NAM countries opposed U.S. intervention, reiterating their 
commitment to non-interference and peaceful coexistence. 

The Non-Aligned Movement stands as a pioneering effort by the non-Western world to shape global politics 
on principles of equality, sovereignty, and development. By offering an alternative to Cold War alliances and 
promoting South-South cooperation, NAM contributed to a more inclusive and equitable international system, 
and its legacy continues to inform the foreign policies of many developing countries today.

Body:  
• Highlight arguments for NAM’s continued role in Global South advocacy and multilateralism, and 

contrast this with critiques emphasizing the role of regional organizations and the trend toward multi-
alignment. 

Conclusion:  
• Summarize NAM’s ongoing relevance in advocating for developing countries while noting its need to 

adapt to the evolving global landscape. 
 
The end of bipolarity following the Cold War and the rise of multiple regional organizations have indeed 
impacted the relevance of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM). NAM was established in 1961 during a period 
of intense Cold War rivalry, aimed at providing newly independent countries an alternative to alignment with 
either the U.S.-led Western bloc or the Soviet bloc. However, with the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 
and the emergence of a unipolar, and now increasingly multipolar, world order, questions have arisen about 
the relevance of NAM in contemporary geopolitics. 

Supporters of NAM's continued relevance argue that it serves as a platform for developing countries to 
address issues specific to the Global South, such as economic inequality, climate change, and sustainable 
development. Scholars like Manjari Chatterjee Miller highlight NAM's role in advocating for multilateralism 
and resisting the hegemony of powerful states. For example, NAM has provided a forum for developing 
nations to voice concerns on economic sanctions, climate justice, and unfair trade practices, particularly within 
global institutions like the United Nations, where smaller nations often feel marginalized. Thus, NAM remains 
a valuable voice for collective bargaining and solidarity on global issues affecting developing countries. 

On the other hand, critics argue that the rise of regional organizations like the African Union (AU), Association 
of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), and the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) has reduced the relevance of 
NAM by providing more focused platforms for regional cooperation and security. These organizations allow 
member countries to address issues more directly relevant to their geographic and political contexts. For 
instance, ASEAN has played a critical role in regional security in Southeast Asia, while the African Union has 
been active in addressing issues like peacekeeping and economic integration on the African continent. 
Furthermore, the emergence of new multilateral frameworks such as BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and 
South Africa) reflects a shift toward more economically-focused coalitions that prioritize pragmatic economic 
cooperation over ideological stances, which was a core component of NAM. 

Moreover, in a multipolar world where power is diffused among multiple actors, the traditional concept of 
nonalignment has shifted. Countries now engage in multi-alignment strategies, pursuing flexible and 
pragmatic foreign policies. India, one of NAM's founding members, exemplifies this by simultaneously 
engaging with the United States, China, and Russia, as well as participating in organizations like BRICS and the 
Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO). According to scholar C. Raja Mohan, this shift towards “strategic 
autonomy” reflects the changing realities of global politics, where nations prioritize national interests over 
bloc-based affiliations. 

While the end of bipolarity and the rise of regional organizations have made NAM less central as a bloc, its 
role in advocating for the interests of the Global South and promoting multilateralism remains relevant. NAM’s 
future effectiveness, however, depends on its ability to adapt to the evolving geopolitical landscape and 
address emerging global challenges in a multipolar world.

Q.17) Highlight the major features of the ‘Non-Alignment 2.0’ document. (2013) (15 Marks) 

 
Approach to write the answer 

 
Introduction:  
• Introduce the Non-Alignment 2.0 document as a strategic framework guiding India's foreign policy in a 

multipolar world. 
Body:  
• Highlight core aspects, including strategic autonomy, economic and military self-reliance, regional 

security, and soft power. 
Conclusion:  
• Summarize Non-Alignment 2.0’s role in positioning India as an influential, independent actor in global 

affairs amidst changing dynamics. 
 
The Non-Alignment 2.0 document, released in 2012, is a strategic framework designed to guide India's foreign 
policy in the 21st century amidst changing global dynamics. Building on the legacy of the Non-Aligned 
Movement (NAM), which emphasized autonomy and neutrality during the Cold War, Non-Alignment 2.0 
provides a roadmap for India to navigate a multipolar world while safeguarding its national interests. Crafted 
by a group of prominent Indian strategists and scholars, the document emphasizes a pragmatic approach to 
foreign policy, balancing autonomy with strategic engagement. 

One of the major features of Non-Alignment 2.0 is the emphasis on strategic autonomy. The document argues 
that India should avoid formal alliances that might constrain its freedom to make independent foreign policy 
decisions. Instead, it advocates for a flexible approach, allowing India to engage with multiple global powers—
such as the United States, Russia, and China—without becoming overly reliant on any single actor. As scholar 
Shivshankar Menon, one of the contributors, noted, strategic autonomy allows India to maintain its 
sovereignty and freedom in a complex geopolitical environment. 

Another key aspect is economic and military self-reliance. The document stresses the need for India to 
strengthen its domestic capabilities, particularly in defense production and technology, to reduce dependency 
on foreign suppliers. It encourages investment in indigenous defense industries, which would enhance India's 
strategic autonomy and bolster its position as a regional power. Economic self-sufficiency is also highlighted, 
with the document advocating for policies that promote economic growth and reduce external vulnerabilities, 
which could otherwise limit India’s diplomatic flexibility. 

Regional security is another priority in Non-Alignment 2.0, as it stresses the importance of stable relations 
within South Asia. The document advises India to adopt a dual strategy of fostering economic cooperation 
with neighboring countries while maintaining the capacity to address security threats. It suggests that India 
act as a net security provider in the region, especially in the Indian Ocean, where its influence is strategically 
significant. 

The document also underlines the importance of soft power and global governance. It encourages India to 
leverage its cultural heritage, democratic values, and developmental model as tools of influence. Furthermore, 
Non-Alignment 2.0 recommends India’s active participation in multilateral institutions like the United Nations,

BRICS, and G20 to shape global norms in alignment with its interests, promoting a more balanced and 
equitable global order. 

Non-Alignment 2.0 outlines a comprehensive and adaptive foreign policy strategy for India, emphasizing 
strategic autonomy, self-reliance, regional stability, and proactive global engagement. As a guiding document, 
it reflects India’s aspirations to play a pivotal role in global affairs while preserving its independence, offering 
a strategic blueprint for India’s evolving position in a multipolar world. 

 
Q.18) The changing global order and ongoing regional conflicts, with the global powers taking sides, have 

jeopardised the progress made towards disarmament in the past. Comment. (2024) (10 Marks) 
 

Approach to write the answer 

 
Introduction:  
• Introduce how shifting global dynamics and regional conflicts have hindered progress toward 

disarmament, with nations prioritizing strategic security. 
Body:  
• Discuss examples of renewed arms races among powers like the U.S., China, and Russia, and highlight 

regional conflicts undermining disarmament. 
Conclusion:  
• Summarize how the fragmented international landscape and security concerns have led to 

rearmament, making disarmament efforts increasingly challenging. 
 
The changing global order and intensifying regional conflicts have significantly hindered progress toward 
disarmament, as global powers increasingly prioritize strategic interests and security alliances over arms 
reduction. Since the end of the Cold War, disarmament efforts made notable strides with agreements like the 
Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START) between the U.S. and Russia, along with the establishment of the 
Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT). However, 
recent geopolitical tensions, particularly among major powers, have stalled or even reversed these gains. 
Scholars like Andrew Futter, in The Politics of Nuclear Weapons (2015), argue that as rivalries intensify, states 
perceive disarmament as a threat to their national security, leading to a rearmament cycle among major 
powers. 

The rivalry between the U.S. and China, for instance, has led both nations to increase their nuclear and military 
capabilities to maintain strategic balance in the Indo-Pacific. China has accelerated its nuclear modernization, 
increasing its arsenal to maintain parity with the U.S., while the U.S. has shifted focus toward countering 
Chinese influence in Asia. This competition has also fueled regional arms races, with nations like India, Japan, 
and South Korea expanding their defense capabilities, thus jeopardizing disarmament. Similarly, Russia’s 
assertive actions in Eastern Europe and the U.S.-led NATO expansion have reignited nuclear posturing, 
exemplified by Russia’s suspension of the New START treaty in 2023. These developments show how 
disarmament becomes secondary when power dynamics shift and regional conflicts emerge. 

Moreover, regional conflicts in areas like Ukraine, the Middle East, and the South China Sea highlight how 
disarmament efforts are undermined when global powers intervene to protect their interests. According to 
T.V. Paul, in Power Versus Prudence: Why Nations Forgo Nuclear Weapons (2000), states are more likely to

pursue military strength, including nuclear arms, if they perceive an immediate threat to their sovereignty. For 
example, Ukraine's conflict with Russia has led to renewed NATO armament in Europe, with the alliance’s 
members enhancing their military infrastructure to deter potential threats. This rearmament focus runs 
counter to disarmament goals and signals to other regions the utility of maintaining or expanding military 
capacities. 

The erosion of multilateral disarmament frameworks further complicates the scenario. As global powers 
pursue unilateral or selective multilateralism, the credibility of arms control treaties suffers, leaving the 
disarmament agenda vulnerable. The weakening of institutions like the NPT and reduced global commitment 
to treaties such as the CTBT illustrate the diminished collective will to prioritize arms reduction in an 
increasingly polarized world. 

The shifting global order and ongoing regional conflicts, influenced by the rivalries and interests of major 
powers, have reversed the progress made toward disarmament, pushing nations toward rearmament to 
secure their interests amid growing uncertainties. This trend underscores the difficulty of pursuing 
disarmament in a fragmented international landscape marked by competition and strategic instability. 

 
Q.19) The expansionist tendencies of the current Russian regime indicate its intentions for the realisation of 

a Greater Russia on the lines of the Soviet era. Comment. Comment. (2024) (10 Marks) 
 

Approach to write the answer 

 
Introduction:  
• Introduce Russia’s expansionist ambitions under Putin as an effort to reassert influence over former 

Soviet territories. 
Body:  
• Discuss examples of Russian actions, including Crimea's annexation, influence in Eastern Ukraine, and 

regional alliances, showing efforts to maintain dominance in Eurasia. 
Conclusion:  
• Summarize Russia’s pursuit of a “Greater Russia,” using military and diplomatic strategies to challenge 

the Western-led order and secure its interests. 
 
The expansionist tendencies of the current Russian regime reflect an ambition to reassert influence over 
territories and states that were once part of the Soviet Union, often interpreted as an effort to realize a vision 
of a “Greater Russia.” Under President Vladimir Putin, Russia has pursued a more assertive foreign policy 
aimed at restoring its regional dominance and challenging the post-Cold War order dominated by Western 
powers. This ambition has manifested in a range of actions, including the annexation of Crimea in 2014, 
military support for separatists in Eastern Ukraine, intervention in Syria, and efforts to exert influence over 
former Soviet republics. 

The annexation of Crimea is perhaps the most prominent example of Russia’s expansionist agenda, marking 
the first time since World War II that European borders were changed by force. Putin justified the move as a 
means of protecting ethnic Russians and securing Russia’s strategic interests in the Black Sea. Many analysts, 
such as Mark Galeotti, interpret this as part of a broader ambition to “recreate a sphere of influence

reminiscent of the Soviet era.” By invoking historical ties and the protection of Russian-speaking populations, 
Putin has effectively used nationalist rhetoric to gain domestic support for his policies while projecting Russia’s 
power abroad. 

Furthermore, Russia’s intervention in Eastern Ukraine and its support for separatist regions like Donetsk and 
Luhansk underscore its desire to maintain influence over neighboring states that seek closer ties with the 
West. This tactic of destabilizing neighboring countries, described by scholars as “hybrid warfare,” allows 
Russia to exert influence without full-scale military invasion. The 2022 invasion of Ukraine intensified these 
expansionist ambitions, as Putin sought to prevent Ukraine’s alignment with NATO and the European Union. 
Political scientist John Mearsheimer argues that Russia views NATO’s eastward expansion as an existential 
threat, and its actions in Ukraine are driven by a desire to create a buffer zone around its borders—a strategic 
interest rooted in both Soviet-era and Russian imperial history. 

Additionally, Russia has maintained significant influence over former Soviet states in Central Asia and the 
Caucasus through the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO) and the Eurasian Economic Union (EEU), 
mechanisms that reinforce its regional hegemony. Countries like Belarus and Kazakhstan remain under 
considerable Russian influence, with Russia often intervening in their internal matters to ensure loyalty. 
Scholar Dmitri Trenin suggests that these moves are not only about reestablishing physical borders but about 
asserting Russian identity and influence as a counterbalance to the West. 

While Russia’s expansionist policies may not signify a full revival of the Soviet Union, they clearly reflect a 
vision for a “Greater Russia” with a sphere of influence that resembles Soviet-era dominance. By leveraging 
military, economic, and cultural tools, Russia seeks to reassert itself as a major power in Eurasia, challenging 
the Western-led global order and securing its strategic interests. 

 
Q.20) "The Gramscian theory of hegemony provides many valuable insights into the nature of global power." 

Comment. (2024) (20 Marks) 
 

Approach to write the answer 

 
Introduction:  
• Introduce Gramsci's theory of hegemony, emphasizing its focus on ideology, culture, and consent in 

maintaining global power. 
Body:  
• Explain how Gramsci’s ideas highlight the role of cultural and ideological dominance in shaping global 

norms, using Cox's adaptations to show how institutions reinforce this power structure. 
Conclusion:  
• Summarize Gramscian hegemony as a framework for understanding power that relies on consensual 

order and aligns subordinate interests with those of dominant powers. 
 
The Gramscian theory of hegemony, developed by Italian Marxist philosopher Antonio Gramsci, offers 
profound insights into the dynamics of global power, particularly by highlighting the role of ideology, culture, 
and consent in maintaining dominance. Unlike traditional notions of power based solely on coercion or military 
strength, Gramsci’s theory posits that true hegemony is achieved when a ruling class (or state) secures the 
consent of subordinate classes by establishing ideological and cultural dominance. This framework has been

adapted by scholars such as Robert Cox to analyze the structures of global power, making it a valuable tool for 
understanding how states and institutions wield influence in the international arena. 

Gramsci argued that ruling classes maintain power not just through force but by shaping the cultural and 
ideological environment, creating what he termed a “common sense” that aligns the interests of the dominant 
group with the broader society. On the global stage, this insight helps explain how powerful states, particularly 
the United States, have cultivated hegemony by promoting liberal capitalist values, democracy, and free-
market ideology as universal norms. By setting these standards through international institutions like the 
World Bank, International Monetary Fund (IMF), and United Nations, the U.S. and its allies have established a 
“hegemonic order” that encourages other nations to adopt policies aligned with Western interests. 

Robert Cox’s adaptation of Gramscian hegemony in his concept of “world order” demonstrates the theory’s 
relevance in analyzing global power structures. Cox argued that global institutions, shaped by dominant states, 
propagate norms and rules that reinforce the existing power hierarchy. For instance, the IMF’s structural 
adjustment programs in the 1980s and 1990s required developing countries to implement neoliberal reforms 
such as privatization and market liberalization. While these programs were presented as universal solutions 
for economic stability, they primarily served to open markets for Western businesses, benefiting dominant 
economies while often deepening poverty and inequality in the Global South. 

Furthermore, Gramsci’s focus on cultural hegemony helps explain how media, education, and popular culture 
contribute to global power. The spread of Western consumer culture and media has normalized lifestyles and 
values that often reflect Western capitalist interests, creating soft power that complements hard economic 
and military power. The dominance of English-language media and Western technology giants like Google and 
Facebook serves as an example of cultural hegemony, subtly influencing global attitudes toward democracy, 
individualism, and consumption. 

Gramscian hegemony illuminates the subtler mechanisms of global power by emphasizing ideological and 
cultural dominance alongside economic and military force. This theory underscores that global power is not 
maintained solely through coercion but through a consensual order that aligns the interests of subordinate 
states with those of dominant powers. As such, Gramsci’s ideas remain instrumental in understanding the 
persistence and resilience of power structures within the modern international system.
