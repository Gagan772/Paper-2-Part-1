## Q11. Is Democracy promotion in developing countries a feasible idea? (2019, 15 Marks)

### 🎯 Core Theme
Democracy promotion in developing countries remains contentious, as external interventions often clash with local socio-political realities, requiring context-specific approaches rather than universal models to ensure sustainable democratic transitions.

### 🔑 Key Recall Terms
`Larry Diamond` | `Samuel Huntington Third Wave` | `Fareed Zakaria illiberal democracies` | `State capacity` | `South Africa transition` | `Iraq Libya failures` | `Institution-building` | `Cultural context`

### 📝 Answer Structure

**Introduction:**
- Democracy promotion raises questions about feasibility, effectiveness, and long-term sustainability
- Democratic ideals have universal appeal: human rights, political participation, rule of law
- Success depends on socio-economic conditions, historical legacies, and political culture
- Context determines whether democracy takes root or creates instability
- Debate centers on external intervention versus organic development

**Body:**

*Arguments for Feasibility:*
- Larry Diamond: democracy promotion necessary for global stability and development
  - Democratic governance protects individual freedoms
  - Fosters economic development and human rights
  - Creates framework for peaceful conflict resolution
- Post-apartheid South Africa as success story
  - Successful transition to democratic system
  - Improved political participation and inclusivity
  - Demonstrates feasibility with proper conditions
- World Bank empirical studies show democracies have:
  - Higher economic growth rates
  - Better health outcomes
  - Stronger human rights protections compared to autocracies
- Democratic Peace Theory: democracies less likely to wage war against each other

*Challenges to Feasibility - Internal Conditions:*
- Samuel Huntington's "The Third Wave" analysis
  - Successful democratization requires favorable internal conditions
  - Robust civil society essential
  - Economic development as prerequisite
  - Institutional stability needed
  - Without preconditions, democracy leads to instability
- Iraq and Libya as negative examples
  - External efforts to impose democracy resulted in chaos
  - Political violence rather than stable governance
  - Demonstrates failure of imposed democracy
  - Ignored local power structures and sectarian divisions

*State Capacity Challenges:*
- Weak institutions undermine democratic processes
  - Corruption as systemic problem
  - Poor governance erodes public trust
  - Lack of administrative capacity for implementation
- Sub-Saharan Africa examples:
  - Zimbabwe: entrenched authoritarian legacies
  - Democratic Republic of Congo: weak state institutions
  - Democratic transitions struggled despite external support
  - Post-colonial institutional weaknesses persist
- Democracy promotion often fails to account for unique socio-political contexts

*Role of External Actors:*
- International organizations and powerful democracies promote democracy
- Criticism of interventions:
  - Often paternalistic in approach
  - Driven by strategic interests rather than genuine democratization
  - Impose Western models without adaptation
- Fareed Zakaria's critique:
  - "Illiberal democracies" emerge in developing countries
  - Elections without liberal institutions (rule of law, civil liberties)
  - Democratic procedures without democratic substance
  - Gap between electoral democracy and liberal democracy

*Need for Contextual Approaches:*
- One-size-fits-all models fail
- Must consider:
  - Local power structures
  - Cultural and religious contexts
  - Historical trajectories
  - Economic development levels
- Emphasis on institution-building over quick transitions
- Long-term capacity development crucial

**Conclusion:**
- Democracy promotion feasible under certain conditions but not universally applicable
- Success depends on socio-economic, cultural, and political contexts
- External interventions must be tailored to local conditions
- Institution-building and long-term capacity development more effective than imposed transitions
- Feasibility lies in careful consideration of challenges and enabling conditions
- Balance between universal democratic values and contextual adaptation essential

## Q14. Comment on the decline of political parties and examine whether new social movements shall be alternative strategies for establishing link between government and society. (2016, 10 Marks)

### 🎯 Core Theme
Political parties face declining public trust and engagement, prompting new social movements to emerge as alternative linkage mechanisms, though NSMs cannot fully replace parties' institutional roles in democratic governance, suggesting need for hybrid approach.

### 🔑 Key Recall Terms
`Peter Mair Ruling the Void` | `Declining party membership` | `Manuel Castells Power of Identity` | `Occupy Wall Street` | `Issue-specific activism` | `Decentralized networks` | `Electoral accountability`

### 📝 Answer Structure

**Introduction:**
- Decline of political parties widely discussed phenomenon
- Parties traditionally main link between government and society
- Growing disillusionment and disengagement from citizens
- Attributed to multiple factors:
  - Erosion of ideological distinctions
  - Rise of political cynicism
  - Growing complexity of issues parties struggle to address
- Question whether NSMs can replace traditional party functions

**Body:**

*Evidence of Political Party Decline:*
- Peter Mair's analysis in "Ruling the Void" (2013):
  - Parties increasingly detached from societal base
  - More integrated into the state apparatus
  - Become part of governing elite rather than representatives
- Visible indicators:
  - Declining party memberships across democracies
  - Reduced voter loyalty to traditional parties
  - Weakened grassroots connections
  - Loss of mobilizing capacity
- European democracies evidence:
  - Major political parties losing members drastically
  - U.K. Labour Party: peaked over 1 million (1950s)
  - Fallen to under 200,000 by 2010
  - Similar trends across Western Europe
- United States trends:
  - Rise in number of independent voters
  - Not affiliating with Democratic or Republican parties
  - Shows increasing distrust in traditional party system
  - Partisan dealignment accelerating

*New Social Movements as Alternatives:*
- NSMs emerged as potential alternatives
- Establish link between government and society differently
- Examples: environmental, feminist, human rights movements
- Focus on specific issues rather than broad platforms
- Operate outside traditional party structures
- Distinctive characteristics:
  - Don't aim to capture state power
  - Focus on influencing policy
  - Raising awareness on specific issues
  - Mobilizing public opinion
- Issue areas: climate change, gender equality, social justice

*Manuel Castells' Analysis:*
- "The Power of Identity" (1997) insights:
  - NSMs less hierarchical than parties
  - More flexible organizational structures
  - Use decentralized networks effectively
  - Employ digital platforms for citizen engagement
  - Increasingly appealing in digital age
  - Network-based rather than hierarchy-based

*Strengths of NSMs:*
- Effective at raising awareness on specific issues
- Can mobilize rapid support through social media
- Bypass traditional gatekeepers
- Direct citizen engagement
- Respond quickly to emerging issues
- Global coordination possible

*Limitations of NSMs as Party Replacements:*
- Ability to provide stable, long-term link debatable
- Political parties still necessary for:
  - Organizing elections systematically
  - Forming governments
  - Ensuring accountability through institutions
  - Policy coordination across issues
  - Legislative representation
- NSMs effective at mobilizing for specific causes
- May lack organizational capacity for governance
- May lack policy expertise for comprehensive solutions
- Difficulty translating momentum into lasting change

*Occupy Wall Street Example:*
- Successfully highlighted income inequality issue
- Generated massive public attention
- Struggled to translate momentum into lasting political change
- Failed to achieve formal policy outcomes
- Demonstrated NSM limitations in institutional politics
- Lacked clear demands and organizational structure

*Need for Both Approaches:*
- Parties provide institutional framework
- NSMs provide grassroots energy and issue focus
- Combination could create more responsive system
- Party reform needed to regain public trust
- Integration of NSM activism into party structures possible

**Conclusion:**
- Political parties experiencing decline in public trust and engagement
- New social movements emerging as alternative channels
- NSMs link government and society through different mechanisms
- Sustainability of movements as party replacement remains uncertain
- NSMs may not fully address structural and institutional roles of parties
- Democratic governance requires formal institutions
- Combination of reformed political parties and NSM activism optimal
- Could create more responsive and inclusive political system
- Both have complementary roles in healthy democracy

  - Creates policy favoring industry over public

*Resource Inequality Issues:*
- Well-funded groups have greater access:
  - Can hire professional lobbyists
  - Fund political campaigns
  - Conduct sophisticated media campaigns
  - Maintain permanent presence in capitals
- Grassroots groups struggle to compete
- Creates democratic deficit in representation

*Need for Regulation and Transparency:*
- Transparency in lobbying practices essential
- Safeguards against undue influence by powerful groups
- Campaign finance reform needed
- Disclosure requirements for lobbying activities
- Limits on revolving door between government and lobbying
