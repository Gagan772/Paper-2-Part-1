### 🎯 Core Theme
The UN Security Council, with its 5 permanent veto-wielding members (P5) and 10 rotating members, maintains global peace through conflict resolution, peacekeeping, and enforcement powers, though P5 veto power often creates gridlock limiting its effectiveness in contemporary conflicts.

### 🔑 Key Recall Terms

## <a id="q3"></a>Q3. Describe the composition of the International Court of Justice (ICJ). Discuss its voluntary jurisdiction. (2022) (15 Marks)

### 🎯 Core Theme
The ICJ's 15-judge composition ensures global legal diversity and impartiality, but its voluntary jurisdiction principle—requiring state consent for contentious cases—fundamentally limits its authority, as powerful states can refuse participation or reject unfavorable judgments.

### 🔑 Key Recall Terms
`15 Judges - Global Representation` | `9-Year Staggered Terms` | `GA and SC Election` | `Major Legal Systems` | `No Two Judges Same State` | `Voluntary Jurisdiction` | `Contentious vs Advisory` | `Article 36 ICJ Statute` | `Optional Clause` | `State Consent Required` | `Nicaragua v.

*Jurisdiction Categories*
- Two types: contentious and advisory
- Contentious: settles disputes between states
- Advisory: provides legal opinions to UN organs
- Contentious jurisdiction limited by voluntary principle
- Court can only adjudicate with state consent
- Distinguishes ICJ from domestic courts with mandatory jurisdiction

*Voluntary Jurisdiction: Three Pathways (Article 36)*
- **First pathway**: Treaties or conventions with ICJ resolution clause
- Bilateral or multilateral agreements specifying ICJ
- **Second pathway**: Special agreement for specific case
- Both parties consent to submit particular dispute
- **Third pathway**: Unilateral declaration accepting compulsory jurisdiction
- Known as "optional clause" under Article 36(2)
- States can accept ICJ jurisdiction without case-specific agreements
- Subject to reservations limiting reach
- Many states add conditions or exclude certain matters

*Constraints of Voluntary Jurisdiction*
- Often constrains ICJ effectiveness
- States can refuse to submit to authority
- May fail to comply with judgments
- Nicaragua v. United States (1986): paradigmatic example
- ICJ ruled in favor of Nicaragua
- Found US intervention violated international law
- US rejected judgment
- Withdrew acceptance of compulsory jurisdiction
- Exemplifies challenges where powerful states evade rulings
- Reduces Court's enforcement capacity

- Voluntary jurisdiction poses fundamental limitations to authority
- Without mandatory jurisdiction, depends on state cooperation
- Particularly difficult when national interests conflict
- Court remains vital institution for promoting international legal principles
- Relies on states' commitment to peaceful dispute resolution
- Moral authority exists despite enforcement limitations
- Continues to contribute to international law development

### 👨‍🎓 Scholars to Quote

✓ **Ad hoc judges** - Appointed when disputing party lacks national on bench  
✓ **Nicaragua v. US (1986)** - US rejected ICJ ruling, withdrew compulsory jurisdiction acceptance  
✓ **Article 36 pathways** - Treaty clauses, special agreements, optional clause declarations
