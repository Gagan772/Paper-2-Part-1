## <a id="q11"></a>Q11. Do you endorse that the United Nations needs major changes in its structure and functioning? Suggest changes for efficient improvements. (2016) (15 Marks)

### 🎯 Core Theme
The UN's 1945 post-WWII structure, centered on P5 Security Council dominance, fails to reflect contemporary geopolitical realities. Essential reforms include expanding UNSC membership to include emerging powers (India, Brazil, Germany, Japan), limiting veto use in mass atrocities cases, and enhancing administrative efficiency through transparency and streamlined peacekeeping operations.
