## Q5. Critically analyze the role of ASEAN in the promotion of regional peace and security through economic cooperation and trade. (2020) (15 Marks)

### 🎯 Core Theme
ASEAN promotes regional peace through economic interdependence via AFTA and RCEP ($662.6B intra-ASEAN trade in 2020), creating a "security community" where force among members is unthinkable. However, its "ASEAN Way" of non-interference limits effectiveness in addressing internal conflicts (Rohingya crisis) and external security threats (South China Sea), with ARF mechanisms criticized as lacking concrete action despite economic success fostering stability.

### 🔑 Key Recall Terms
`ASEAN Way Non-Interference` | `AFTA Trade Integration` | `RCEP Partnership` | `$662.6B Intra-Trade` | `Security Community` | `Rohingya Crisis Failure` | `South China Sea Disputes` | `ARF Limitations` | `Economic Interdependence` | `Human Rights Gaps`

### 📝 Answer Structure

**Introduction:**
- ASEAN established 1967
- Aims: economic growth, political stability, cultural development
- "ASEAN Way": consensus-building and non-interference
- Instrumental in maintaining stability
- Amitav Acharya: successfully created "security community"
- Use of force among member states virtually unthinkable
- Largely due to economic interdependence (Constructing a Security Community)

**Economic Cooperation Success:**
- ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA)
- Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP)
- Significantly boosted intra-regional trade and investment
- Economic cooperation links member states' economies
- Reduces incentives for conflict, enhances stability
- Intra-ASEAN trade reached $662.6 billion in 2020
- Showcases interdependence contributing to peace and prosperity
- Economic integration attracted global investments
- Transformed ASEAN into major economic bloc
- Enhanced leverage in international diplomacy
- Centrality in ASEAN+3 and East Asia Summit processes

**Criticism - Limited Security Mechanism:**
- Economic cooperation hasn't fully translated into effective security
- Non-interference principle: double-edged sword
- Limits ability to address internal conflicts and human rights abuses
- Rohingya crisis in Myanmar: muted ASEAN response
- Demonstrates reluctance to engage in political/humanitarian issues
- Prioritizes state sovereignty over collective security
- David Capie & Paul Evans: reluctance undermines credibility
- ASEAN's credibility as security organization questioned (Asia-Pacific Security Lexicon)

**ARF Limitations:**
- ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) formed for security dialogues
- Criticized as lacking concrete action
- South China Sea disputes highlight ASEAN's limitations
- Involves China and several ASEAN countries
- Inability to present united front
- Cannot enforce agreements like Declaration on Conduct (DOC)
- Shows challenges balancing economic cooperation with security concerns
- China's influence complicates unified ASEAN response

**Balancing Challenge:**
- Effective in promoting economic interdependence
- Less effective in addressing broader security issues
- Need for more proactive approach
- Balance non-interference with collective action
- Particularly for internal conflicts and external threats

**Conclusion:**
- Economic cooperation contributed to regional peace through interdependence
- Effectiveness in broader security issues remains limited
- Enhancement requires balancing non-interference with collective action
- Must address internal conflicts and external threats more effectively

## Q6. Since its inception the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) has failed to deliver on its promise. What initiatives should be taken to reinvigorate the organisation? (2018) (15 Marks)

### 🎯 Core Theme
SAARC (est. 1985) failed due to India-Pakistan rivalry paralyzing decision-making (2016 summit cancelled), weak institutional framework lacking enforcement authority, and minimal economic integration (<5% intra-regional trade vs ASEAN's 25%). Reinvigoration requires depoliticizing through conflict resolution mechanisms, deepening SAFTA for customs union, promoting infrastructure connectivity, and empowering the Secretariat with monitoring bodies and civil society involvement for implementation effectiveness.

### 🔑 Key Recall Terms
`SAARC 1985` | `India-Pakistan Rivalry` | `2016 Summit Cancellation` | `<5% Intra-Regional Trade` | `SAFTA Agreement` | `Weak Institutional Framework` | `Depoliticization Strategy` | `Conflict Resolution Mechanisms` | `Infrastructure Connectivity` | `Civil Society Involvement`

### 📝 Answer Structure

**Introduction:**
- SAARC established in 1985
- Vision: regional integration, cooperation, development
- Member states: vast population and economic potential
- Struggled to deliver on promises
- Political conflicts, particularly India-Pakistan
- Economic disparities among members
- Structural limitations within organization
- C. Raja Mohan: inability to overcome geopolitical tensions
- India-Pakistan rivalry paralyzed decision-making and hindered progress

**Limited Mandate and Weak Framework:**
- Unlike EU or ASEAN, SAARC lacks enforcement authority
- Cannot enforce agreements or resolve conflicts
- Often symbolic rather than substantive presence
- 19th SAARC summit (2016) postponed due to India-Pakistan tensions
- Bilateral issues disrupt multilateral cooperation
- Economic integration remains low
- Intra-regional trade <5% of total trade
- Significantly lower than ASEAN's ~25%

**Initiative 1 - Depoliticization:**
- Shift towards depoliticizing organization
- Create mechanisms prioritizing economic and development cooperation
- Separate from political disputes
- Establish conflict resolution frameworks (like ASEAN Regional Forum)
- Mitigate tensions, focus on shared economic/social goals
- Employ neutral entities or third-party mediators
- Address India-Pakistan conflicts separately
- Allow rest of region to progress on cooperation

**Initiative 2 - Economic Integration:**
- Deepen economic integration
- Enhance South Asian Free Trade Area (SAFTA) agreement
- Create customs union
- Promote cross-border investments
- Stimulate trade and economic growth
- Promote infrastructure projects: energy and transport corridors
- Strengthen physical and economic connectivity
- Similar to Belt and Road Initiative but intra-regional focus

**Initiative 3 - Institutional Strengthening:**
- Empower SAARC institutions (especially Secretariat)
- Provide greater authority and resources
- Establish independent monitoring bodies
- Create policy advisory groups
- Implement agreements more effectively
- Involve civil society and private sector stakeholders
- Create more inclusive and responsive framework
- Enhance decision-making participation

**Conclusion:**
- SAARC struggled due to geopolitical tensions and structural weaknesses
- Depoliticizing agenda essential
- Enhancing economic integration critical
- Strengthening institutional frameworks necessary
- Measures crucial for achieving SAARC's potential
- Platform for regional growth and stability

```

### ✨ Power Conclusion
**"SAARC's failure—with intra-regional trade languishing below 5% compared to ASEAN's 25% and summits cancelled over bilateral disputes—demonstrates that regional organizations cannot thrive when geopolitical rivalries trump economic cooperation; reinvigoration demands radical depoliticization through third-party conflict resolution, aggressive SAFTA enhancement toward customs union, infrastructure-driven connectivity like energy corridors, and institutional empowerment of the Secretariat with civil society participation to transform SAARC from a symbolic forum into an engine of South Asian prosperity."**

## Q7. American President Donald Trump's proposal to withdraw from NAFTA would bring unforeseen consequences to the regionalisation of world politics. Elaborate. (2017) (10 Marks)

### 🎯 Core Theme
Trump's NAFTA withdrawal proposal (reflecting "America First" economic nationalism) threatened to disrupt deeply integrated North American supply chains, signaling U.S. retreat from traditional free trade leadership. Though it led to USMCA with stricter labor/environmental standards, the uncertainty undermined U.S. reliability as trade partner, potentially encouraging Latin America toward MERCOSUR or China's Belt and Road, setting a protectionist precedent that could weaken global multilateral trade norms.

### 🔑 Key Recall Terms
`NAFTA 1994` | `America First Policy` | `Economic Nationalism` | `USMCA Renegotiation` | `Supply Chain Disruption` | `U.S. Trade Leadership Retreat` | `Dani Rodrik Backlash` | `Latin America Pivot` | `Belt and Road Alternative` | `Multilateralism Undermined`

### 📝 Answer Structure

**Introduction:**
- Trump's proposal to withdraw from NAFTA marked significant shift
- NAFTA signed in 1994: US, Canada, Mexico
- Designed to promote economic integration, eliminate tariffs
- Trump's decision reflected "America First" policy
- Emphasis on economic nationalism
- Aimed to prioritize American jobs and industries
- Over global or regional economic cooperation

**Rationale for Withdrawal:**
- Trump believed NAFTA unfavorable to American workers/industries
- Argued it led to job losses in U.S. manufacturing sector
- Widened trade deficit with Mexico
- Dani Rodrik: backlash against free trade agreements
- Often benefit multinational corporations while neglecting local workforce
- Resonated with Trump's base
- Withdrawal would disrupt deeply integrated supply chains
- Affect automotive, agriculture industries
- Impact small and medium enterprises dependent on cross-border trade

**Beyond North America:**
- Implications extended beyond North America
- Message: U.S. reconsidering traditional free trade commitments
- U.S. traditionally champion of free trade and economic regionalism
- Potential to undermine other regional trade blocs
- Questioned reliability of U.S. as partner
- Latin American countries previously dependent on American leadership
- Could shift focus to MERCOSUR or China's Belt and Road Initiative

**USMCA Result:**
- Renegotiation led to USMCA (United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement)
- Preserved many NAFTA elements
- Introduced stricter rules: labor, environmental standards, intellectual property
- Trump's approach to reshape rather than dismantle
- Uncertainty from rhetoric influenced global perceptions
- Illustrated move away from multilateralism
- Set precedent weakening global trade norms
- Other countries might follow: renegotiate or abandon agreements

**Conclusion:**
- Not just about renegotiating trade terms
- Represented broader challenge to regional economic cooperation principles
- Led to reformation into USMCA
- Uncertainty and protectionism shift significant
- Departure from traditional U.S. leadership
- Long-term consequences for regional trade systems worldwide

### ✨ Power Conclusion
**"Brexit shattered the myth of inevitable regional integration by exposing the tension between national sovereignty and supranationalism—fueling Euroscepticism across France and Italy while stripping the EU of London's financial dominance and a major military power—yet paradoxically forced deeper integration through the post-COVID Recovery Fund, simultaneously revealing to ASEAN, the African Union, and MERCOSUR that even the world's most successful regional bloc remains vulnerable when member states prioritize sovereignty over collective identity, fundamentally questioning the resilience of regionalization as a model for 21st-century global governance."**

### ✨ Power Conclusion
**"Regionalism fundamentally reshapes world politics by transforming isolated nation-states into powerful economic blocs like the EU and ASEAN that collectively challenge American hegemony, enabling smaller nations to amplify their influence in forums like the South China Sea while providing security through AU peacekeeping—yet simultaneously creates dangerous fault lines where competing regional projects like Russia's EAEU clash with EU/NATO expansion, proving that regional cooperation is both a stabilizing force for 'peace in parts' (Joseph Nye) and a source of new geopolitical tensions in the multipolar 21st century."**

### ✨ Power Conclusion
**"The European Union exemplifies unprecedented regional integration as the world's most influential entity—commanding 15% of global GDP through its single market, projecting diplomatic clout via Iran nuclear mediation, uniting 450+ million people across diverse cultures through the historic 2004 Eastern expansion, and wielding the Euro as the world's second-most traded currency—proving that supranational governance under Moravcsik's 'liberal intergovernmentalism' can transcend national boundaries to create a powerful actor shaping international norms, despite persistent challenges from Brexit and internal divisions threatening its cohesion."**
