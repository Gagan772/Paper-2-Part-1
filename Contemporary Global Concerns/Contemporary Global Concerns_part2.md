## <a id="q11"></a>Q11. Examine the main problems and challenges involved in looking after environmental concerns in world politics. (2016) (20 Marks)

### 🎯 Core Theme
Environmental concerns in world politics face challenges from conflicting national interests, sovereignty constraints, economic development tensions, resource inequalities, and weak enforcement mechanisms, requiring coordinated global efforts balancing economic growth with sustainability.

### 🔑 Key Recall Terms
Economic development vs environment | Arthur Pigou | Polluter Pays Principle | Robert Keohane | Complex interdependence | Green Climate Fund | Sovereignty concerns | Resource inequality | Climate-induced displacement | Technology transfer | Sahel conflicts

### 📝 Answer Structure

**Introduction:**
- Challenges due to conflicting national interests
- Economic priorities versus environmental protection
- Complex nature of global governance
- Tension between development and conservation

**Body:**

**Economic Development vs Environmental Protection:**
- Developing countries: strict regulations inhibit economic growth
- Rely heavily on natural resource exploitation
- Arthur Pigou: "Polluter Pays Principle"
- Those responsible for pollution bear management costs
- Developing nations: historical responsibility lies with industrialized nations
- Creates significant divide
- Evident in Kyoto Protocol (1997) and Paris Agreement (2015)

**Global Cooperation Challenges:**
- International system fundamentally state-centric
- Sovereignty trumps collective environmental action
- Robert Keohane's "complex interdependence" theory
- Global environmental issues require transnational cooperation
- Sovereignty concerns and differing national interests
- Make consensus difficult
- U.S. withdrawal from Paris Agreement (2017)
- National political shifts undermine global initiatives
- Shows fragility of multilateral agreements

**Resource and Technology Inequality:**
- Unequal distribution of resources and technological capabilities
- Developed nations: financial and technological resources for green policies
- Developing countries: inadequate infrastructure and capacity
- Green Climate Fund established 2010
- Aimed to support developing nations
- Promised $100 billion per year remains underfunded
- Challenges in mobilizing financial support
- Amartya Sen: without addressing inequalities, policies insufficient and inequitable

**Interconnected Broader Issues:**
- Environmental concerns linked to poverty, migration, geopolitical conflicts
- Climate-induced displacement: growing crisis
- Lacks legal framework under international law
- Millions left vulnerable
- Competition for scarce resources: water and arable land
- Exacerbates conflicts
- Sahel region: environmental degradation intensified disputes and migration

**Conclusion:**
- Deeply entangled with economic interests, sovereignty, resource inequalities
- Despite frameworks like Paris Agreement, real progress requires:
  - Greater financial commitment
  - Technological transfers
  - Rethinking development paradigms
- Balance economic growth with sustainability
- Without coordinated efforts, governance remains challenging

## <a id="q20"></a>Q20. Discuss the Utility of nuclear deterrence theory in the context of the recent standoff between India and Pakistan. (2019) (10 Marks)

### 🎯 Core Theme
Nuclear deterrence theory remains relevant in India-Pakistan relations, preventing full-scale war through mutually assured destruction (MAD), as demonstrated in the 2019 Pulwama-Balakot crisis, yet simultaneously enabling lower-level conflicts under the nuclear umbrella per the stability-instability paradox.

### 🔑 Key Recall Terms
Thomas Schelling | Mutually assured destruction | Pulwama 2019 | Balakot airstrike | Kenneth Waltz | Zafar Nawaz Jaspal | SIPRI | Stability-instability paradox | Scott Sagan | Nuclear umbrella | Proxy wars

**Stability-Instability Paradox:**
- Utility not without criticisms
- Sagan's "stability-instability paradox"
- Nuclear weapons prevent full-scale wars
- Also embolden lower-level conflicts and provocations
- Evident in recurring cross-border incidents and militant attacks
- Don't lead to war but keep region in perpetual tension
- Pulwama attack and India's response
- Both nations operate under assumption
- Nuclear weapons will prevent escalation beyond conventional levels

**Conclusion:**

## <a id="q21"></a>Q21. Discuss the implications of the Trump-Kim Singapore summit on the prospect of Denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula. (2018) (15 Marks)

### 🎯 Core Theme
The June 2018 Trump-Kim Singapore summit was historically symbolic but substantively limited, lacking specific timelines, verification mechanisms, and concrete steps, resulting in temporary de-escalation but no sustainable pathway to Korean peninsula denuclearization, with outcomes remaining largely reversible and unverifiable.

- Overly reliant on personal diplomacy
- Trump described relationship with Kim as "love"
- Scott Snyder (Council on Foreign Relations)
- Personalized diplomacy undermined broader process
- Bypassed established negotiation protocols
- Failed to hold North Korea accountable
- North Korea demolished parts of nuclear testing site
- Analysts from 38 North and monitoring organizations
- Actions largely symbolic and reversible
- Lacked independent verification

**Lack of Framework:**
- Summit's mixed outcomes left denuclearization uncertain
- Absence of clear framework for disarmament and verification
- Situation where NK retains nuclear capabilities
- While engaging in further summits
- Negotiates from position of strength

**Conclusion:**
- Trump-Kim Singapore summit momentarily eased tensions
- Opened diplomatic channels
- Fell short of creating sustainable pathway to denuclearization
- Future of denuclearized Korean peninsula remains contingent
- Whether subsequent negotiations achieve verifiable commitments
- Build on summit's initial, albeit limited, progress

### ✨ Power Conclusion
*"From Tehran's burning hijabs to Delhi's candlelight vigils, from Buenos Aires' purple waves to Lagos' #BringBackOurGirls, women's movements reveal a universal truth: patriarchal violence knows no borders, and neither does feminist resistance—demanding that women's physical autonomy be recognized not as cultural privilege but as inalienable human right."*
