5 Approaches to study International Relations 
 
 

Q.1) In what ways does the functionalist approach in International relations help in maintaining peace and 
order in global politics? (2023) (15 Marks) 

 
Approach to write the answer 

 
Introduction:  
• Introduce the functionalist approach in International Relations (IR) as a means of fostering peace 

through cooperation in non-political, technical, and economic areas. 
Body:  
• Explain how functionalism, as developed by David Mitrany, promotes global stability by encouraging 

interdependence, with examples like the EU and international climate agreements. 
Conclusion:  
• Highlight how functionalism reduces conflict and enhances long-term peace by focusing on shared 

global challenges rather than political power struggles. 
 
The functionalist approach in International Relations (IR) plays a significant role in maintaining peace and order 
in global politics by emphasizing cooperation through non-political, technical, and economic institutions. 
Developed by scholars like David Mitrany, functionalism posits that global peace can be achieved not by 
focusing on traditional political and military power but by fostering international collaboration in areas of 
shared interest, such as trade, health, and environmental management. By promoting interdependence 
among states, functionalism aims to reduce the likelihood of conflict and enhance global stability. 

Mitrany, in his seminal work A Working Peace System (1943), argued that cooperation in technical and 
economic spheres would gradually lead to political cooperation and integration. He believed that when 
nations work together to solve common problems, such as poverty, disease, or climate change, they develop 
habits of cooperation that make conflict less likely. This principle is seen in the creation of global institutions 
like the World Health Organization (WHO) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which help foster 
peaceful relations by addressing global challenges that no single state can solve alone. 

The European Union (EU) offers a practical example of the functionalist approach at work. Initially created 
through economic cooperation via the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) in 1951, the EU evolved 
into a broader political and economic union. By linking the economies of former rivals like France and 
Germany, functionalist cooperation helped to integrate these countries, reducing the likelihood of war in 
Europe. The success of the EU demonstrates how economic and technical integration can lead to lasting peace 
and political unity, aligning with Mitrany’s vision. 

Functionalism also manifests in global climate action. The Paris Agreement of 2015 exemplifies how states 
come together to address the common challenge of climate change. By focusing on a functional issue that 
affects all nations, countries work collaboratively despite their political differences. This cooperation fosters 
dialogue, reduces tensions, and contributes to global peace by emphasizing shared goals over divisive politics.

The functionalist approach helps maintain peace and order in global politics by fostering cooperation in non-
political areas, which in turn creates interdependence and mutual trust among states. By addressing shared 
technical and economic challenges, functionalism mitigates conflicts and contributes to long-term global 
stability, as seen in examples like the EU and international environmental agreements. 

 
Q.2) What do you mean by offensive and defensive realism?  (2023) (15 Marks) 

 
Approach to write the answer 

 
Introduction:  
• Introduce offensive and defensive realism as two strands within the realist school of international 

relations, focusing on power and security in the anarchic international system. 
Body:  
• Explain that offensive realism emphasizes aggressive power maximization for survival, while defensive 

realism advocates for cautious power accumulation to avoid provoking counterbalancing threats. 
Conclusion:  
• Highlight that both theories offer contrasting views on state behavior, with offensive realism promoting 

power expansion and defensive realism warning against overreach, explaining various state actions. 
 
Offensive and defensive realism are two distinct strands within the realist school of thought in international 
relations, both of which focus on the role of power and security but differ in their explanations of state 
behavior. Both derive from the broader framework of realism, which emphasizes the anarchic structure of the 
international system, where no overarching authority exists to enforce rules or protect states, compelling 
them to rely on self-help strategies. However, offensive and defensive realism diverge in their perspectives on 
how states should approach power accumulation and security. 

Offensive realism, as articulated by John Mearsheimer in The Tragedy of Great Power Politics (2001), argues 
that in an anarchic international system, states must pursue aggressive strategies to maximize their power. 
According to Mearsheimer, the primary goal of states is to achieve hegemony, as this is the best way to ensure 
their survival. Offensive realism posits that states are never satisfied with the status quo; they constantly seek 
to gain relative power over their rivals, as more power reduces the likelihood of being threatened. 
Mearsheimer famously argues, "The best defense is a good offense," suggesting that states must be prepared 
to expand their influence, whether through military, economic, or diplomatic means. Historical examples, such 
as Nazi Germany's aggressive expansion in the 1930s or the U.S.'s global dominance after World War II, are 
often cited as evidence of offensive realism in practice. 

In contrast, defensive realism, primarily associated with Kenneth Waltz and his work Theory of International 
Politics (1979), contends that states seek power primarily to ensure their security, not necessarily to maximize 
it beyond what is necessary. Defensive realists argue that while the international system compels states to be 
concerned with security, excessive power accumulation can provoke balancing behavior from other states, 
leading to greater insecurity. Waltz’s structural realism suggests that the international system punishes states 
that attempt to pursue hegemony because such actions invite counterbalancing coalitions, as seen during the 
Cold War when the Soviet Union’s expansionist policies triggered alliances like NATO. Defensive realists 
advocate for a cautious approach, emphasizing balancing power rather than aggressively expanding it. For

instance, China’s "peaceful rise" strategy has been interpreted as an example of defensive realism, where the 
focus is on gradually increasing power without alarming rival states. 

Both theories highlight the importance of power, but while offensive realism argues that maximizing power 
leads to security, defensive realism warns against overreach. In practice, state behavior often reflects a mix of 
both. The U.S.'s foreign policy, for example, has oscillated between offensive actions, such as the invasion of 
Iraq in 2003, and defensive strategies, like maintaining alliances to balance against potential threats. 

Offensive and defensive realism provide contrasting lenses through which to view state behavior in the 
anarchic international system. While offensive realism advocates for power maximization, defensive realism 
stresses maintaining a balance to avoid provoking unnecessary conflict. Both approaches help explain different 
historical and contemporary state actions on the global stage. 

 
Q.3) What is the realist prescription to the States to ensure their survival in an anarchical world? (2022) (15 

Marks) 
 

Approach to write the answer 

 
Introduction:  
• Introduce realism as a theory in international relations that emphasizes state survival in an anarchic 

world without a central authority. 
Body:  
• Explain that realism prescribes power accumulation, balancing against threats, and strategic diplomacy, 

with military power and alliances as key tools for state security. 
Conclusion:  
• Highlight that realism advises states to focus on self-help and careful management of power to navigate 

the hostile international system and ensure survival. 
 
Realism, a dominant theory in international relations, offers a pragmatic and often pessimistic prescription for 
states to ensure their survival in an anarchical world where no central authority exists to enforce order. 
Realists argue that the international system is characterized by anarchy, meaning the absence of a global 
government, and thus states must rely on self-help to secure their interests and survival. This perspective is 
rooted in the works of classical realists like Hans Morgenthau, who in Politics Among Nations (1948) 
emphasized that states must prioritize national interest and power to navigate an inherently hostile 
international environment. 

The realist prescription to ensure survival revolves around the concept of power. States are urged to maximize 
their military and economic capabilities to deter potential threats and dominate the international arena. 
Realists view power, particularly military power, as the ultimate means of ensuring security in a competitive 
international system. Kenneth Waltz, in his Theory of International Politics (1979), developed the theory of 
structural realism (or neorealism), which asserts that in an anarchical system, the distribution of power, 
especially in the form of military strength, dictates the behavior of states. Therefore, states should build and 
maintain robust military capabilities to defend themselves against external threats.

Another key aspect of the realist prescription is balancing power. In an anarchic world, realists suggest that 
states should form alliances or balance against more powerful states or coalitions to prevent any one state 
from becoming too dominant. For example, during the Cold War, the formation of military alliances such as 
NATO and the Warsaw Pact was a classic case of balancing, where states sought to maintain a power 
equilibrium to prevent dominance by either the United States or the Soviet Union. Waltz argued that balancing 
is a natural reaction for states seeking to preserve their independence and security. 

Realism also emphasizes the importance of strategic diplomacy and maintaining flexibility in alliances. Realists 
like John Mearsheimer, in his work The Tragedy of Great Power Politics (2001), assert that states should be 
willing to shift alliances or form temporary partnerships to ensure survival. For instance, during World War II, 
the United States allied with the Soviet Union against Nazi Germany despite their ideological differences, 
illustrating the realist principle that survival and power take precedence over ideological alignment. 

Despite the focus on power, realists also highlight the dangers of overextension. Morgenthau warned against 
“imperial overstretch,” where states pursue expansive goals that outstrip their resources, leading to 
vulnerability. Realism, therefore, urges prudence in foreign policy decisions, cautioning against unnecessary 
wars or excessive ambitions that could weaken the state's security. 

Realism prescribes that states should focus on accumulating power, balancing against potential threats, and 
practicing pragmatic diplomacy to ensure their survival in an anarchic international system. In a world without 
a global enforcer, survival is secured by self-help, alliances, and the careful management of power. 

 
Q.4) Discuss the emergence of neo-realism and its basic tenets (2021) (15 Marks) 

 
Approach to write the answer 

 
Introduction:  
• Introduce neo-realism, or structural realism, as a response to classical realism, emphasizing the 

international system's structure in shaping state behavior. 
Body:  
• Explain key tenets, such as the anarchic system, balance of power, state rationality, and relative gains, 

using examples like the Cold War and security dilemmas. 
Conclusion:  
• Highlight neo-realism's impact on international relations, offering a structured analysis of global politics 

based on power dynamics and state security concerns. 
 
Neo-realism, also known as structural realism, emerged in the late 20th century as a response to the 
limitations of classical realism in international relations theory. Primarily associated with the works of Kenneth 
Waltz, particularly his 1979 book Theory of International Politics, neo-realism redefined the theoretical 
landscape by emphasizing the structure of the international system as the key determinant of state behavior 
rather than human nature or domestic factors. 

At the heart of neo-realism is the notion that the international system is anarchic, meaning there is no 
overarching authority to enforce rules or maintain order among states. This anarchic structure compels states 
to prioritize their survival and security, leading them to act in ways that can be understood through a power-

centric lens. Waltz argues that “the structure of the international system is the central influence on state 
behavior,” asserting that it shapes the distribution of capabilities among states and subsequently determines 
their interactions. 

One of the basic tenets of neo-realism is the concept of the balance of power. Neo-realists contend that states 
are motivated to maintain their security and will therefore seek to balance against more powerful states. This 
can manifest through internal balancing (increasing military capabilities) or external balancing (forming 
alliances). The Cold War period exemplifies this principle, as the United States and the Soviet Union engaged 
in a strategy of containment and alliance-building to counter each other's influence, leading to a bipolar world 
order characterized by military and ideological competition. 

Another important tenet of neo-realism is the idea of state rationality and unitary actors. Neo-realists assume 
that states act as rational entities, making decisions based on calculations of national interest and power. This 
perspective simplifies the complexities of domestic politics and focuses on how states interact in pursuit of 
their security objectives. For example, the decisions made by nations during the Gulf War in 1990-1991 can 
be analyzed through a neo-realist lens, where states formed coalitions to counter Iraq's aggression based on 
collective security concerns. 

Furthermore, neo-realism introduces the concept of relative gains, emphasizing that states are more 
concerned about how their power and security compare to others rather than absolute gains. This perspective 
often leads to security dilemmas, where the actions taken by one state to enhance its security inadvertently 
threaten others, prompting an arms race or escalation of tensions, as seen in the nuclear proliferation debates 
in South Asia. 

Neo-realism has significantly shaped the field of international relations by offering a structured analysis of 
state behavior grounded in the anarchic nature of the international system. By focusing on power dynamics, 
state rationality, and the importance of balancing strategies, neo-realism provides a compelling framework 
for understanding the complexities of global politics in a rapidly changing world.

Classical Realism, as articulated by Hans Morgenthau in his seminal work Politics Among Nations (1948), and 
Neorealism, introduced by Kenneth Waltz in Theory of International Politics (1979), represent two significant 
schools of thought in international relations. While both theories share the foundational belief that 
international politics is driven by the pursuit of power and that the international system is anarchic, they differ 
in their focus, assumptions, and analytical approaches. 

One of the primary differences lies in the understanding of human nature. Classical Realism, as espoused by 
Morgenthau, emphasizes the inherently flawed and selfish nature of humans. Morgenthau argues that 
international politics is driven by the "will to power" rooted in human nature. According to Morgenthau, 
leaders act out of a desire to dominate, and conflicts arise due to this inherent lust for power. His theory is 
grounded in a philosophical view that power politics is an inevitable consequence of human nature. 
Morgenthau states, "Politics, like society in general, is governed by objective laws that have their roots in 
human nature." 

In contrast, Kenneth Waltz’s Neorealism—also known as Structural Realism—shifts the focus from human 
nature to the structure of the international system. Waltz argues that it is not the inherent characteristics of 
humans that drive states' behavior, but rather the anarchic nature of the international system. According to 
Waltz, the lack of a central authority compels states to act in a self-help manner, prioritizing survival and 
security. In Theory of International Politics, Waltz posits that the distribution of power (whether the system is 
unipolar, bipolar, or multipolar) determines the behavior of states. Thus, while Morgenthau focuses on 
individual leaders and their motivations, Waltz sees the structure of the international system as the primary 
determinant of state behavior. 

Another major difference is their approach to power. Classical Realism views power primarily in terms of 
military capabilities and political influence. Morgenthau asserts that the pursuit of power is the main goal of 
states, leading to competition and conflict. Neorealism, however, conceptualizes power in more structural 
terms. Waltz argues that power is not an end in itself but a means to achieve security. States seek to balance 
power in the international system to ensure their survival, and the balance of power is seen as a stabilizing 
force in global politics. 

Additionally, Classical Realism tends to focus on the moral and ethical dimensions of statecraft. Morgenthau 
acknowledges the role of ethics in international relations but is skeptical about its influence, given the realities 
of power politics. Neorealism, on the other hand, is more scientific and structural in its approach, dismissing 
the role of morality in the anarchic system. Waltz's Neorealism seeks to establish a more rigorous, objective 
analysis of international relations, focusing on empirical patterns of state behavior. 

For example, during the Cold War, Morgenthau would argue that the U.S.-Soviet rivalry was fueled by the 
leaders' desire for dominance, whereas Waltz would contend that the bipolar structure of the international 
system made this conflict inevitable. 

While both Classical Realism and Neorealism share core assumptions about power and anarchy, they differ in 
their understanding of what drives state behavior—Morgenthau focuses on human nature and power politics, 
while Waltz emphasizes the structure of the international system and the quest for security.

Approach to write the answer 

 
Introduction:  
• Introduce classical Realism as a key framework in international relations, focused on power, self-

interest, and survival in an anarchic global system. 
Body:  
• Explain its strengths in understanding power dynamics and state behavior but highlight its limitations 

in addressing international cooperation, non-state actors, and transnational challenges in the modern 
world. 

Conclusion:  
• Conclude that while classical Realism offers valuable insights into power politics, it is not the "best" 

method for understanding all aspects of today’s complex global system, requiring complementary 
frameworks. 

 
Realism, particularly classical Realism, has long been regarded as one of the most influential frameworks for 
understanding international relations (IR). Rooted in the writings of thinkers like Thucydides, Thomas Hobbes, 
and later Hans Morgenthau, Realism is based on the premise that international relations are driven primarily 
by the pursuit of power, self-interest, and survival in an anarchic global system. While Realism has been 
foundational in shaping IR theory, its suitability as the "best" method for understanding global politics is 
debated, especially when applied to the complexities of the modern world. 

Classical Realism emphasizes the inherently conflictual nature of international relations. It posits that states, 
as rational actors, are primarily concerned with their own survival and security. As Hans Morgenthau outlines 
in Politics Among Nations (1948), power is the primary currency in international relations, and moral 
considerations are often subordinate to the pursuit of national interest. For example, during the Cold War, 
Realist principles seemed to explain the behavior of superpowers like the United States and the Soviet Union, 
which engaged in power balancing, nuclear deterrence, and strategic alliances to maximize their security in a 
competitive international environment. 

One of the strengths of classical Realism is its focus on power politics and the idea of anarchy in the 
international system. In the absence of a central authority, states operate in a "self-help" system, where trust 
is minimal, and conflicts of interest are inevitable. This framework has helped explain numerous historical 
events, such as the balance of power strategies in Europe during the 19th and 20th centuries. John 
Mearsheimer, a contemporary proponent of Realism, has argued in The Tragedy of Great Power Politics that 
states will always seek to maximize their relative power, and that competition, rather than cooperation, is the 
defining characteristic of international relations. 

However, while Realism provides a robust framework for understanding power dynamics and state behavior, 
it has limitations in explaining some key aspects of modern international relations. Critics argue that it 
downplays the importance of international institutions, norms, and non-state actors, which have become 
increasingly relevant in the globalized world. Liberal theorists, such as Robert Keohane in After Hegemony, 
argue that institutions like the United Nations and the World Trade Organization help mitigate anarchy by 
fostering cooperation, reducing uncertainty, and promoting interdependence among states.

Furthermore, Realism often overlooks the role of domestic politics and ideology in shaping foreign policy. 
Classical Realism assumes that states act as unitary, rational actors, but scholars like Graham Allison, in his 
Bureaucratic Politics Model, show that internal politics and bureaucratic struggles can heavily influence 
international decision-making, such as during the Cuban Missile Crisis. 

Realism also struggles to account for the rise of non-state actors and transnational threats, such as terrorism, 
climate change, and global health crises. These challenges require multilateral cooperation, diplomacy, and 
international governance—factors that Realism, with its focus on state-centric power politics, tends to 
underestimate. 

While classical Realism remains an essential method for understanding international relations, especially in 
terms of power dynamics and conflict, it is not necessarily the "best" method for comprehensively explaining 
the complexities of today’s global system. Its focus on state behavior and power struggles provides valuable 
insights, but its limitations in addressing international cooperation, non-state actors, and transnational issues 
suggest that other frameworks, such as Liberalism or Constructivism, are also necessary to fully understand 
the evolving landscape of international relations. 

 
Q.7) Identify the major differences between the classical Realism of Hans J Morgenthau and the Neorealism 

of Kenneth Waltz. Which process is the best suited for analysing international relations after the cold 
war? (2015) (10 Marks)

Introduction:  
• Introduce the major differences between Morgenthau's classical realism and Waltz’s neorealism, both 

rooted in the realist tradition but differing in their focus on power and state behavior. 
Body:  
• Explain that classical realism centers on human nature and individual state leaders, while neorealism 

emphasizes the international system’s structure and state survival in an anarchic system. 
Conclusion:  
• Highlight that neorealism is more suited for analyzing post-Cold War power dynamics, while classical 

realism remains relevant for understanding leadership and moral dilemmas in global politics. 
 
The major differences between the classical realism of Hans J. Morgenthau and the neorealism of Kenneth 
Waltz lie primarily in their understanding of power, human nature, and the structure of the international 
system. Both theories are rooted in the realist tradition, which emphasizes the role of power and an anarchic 
international system. However, Morgenthau’s classical realism focuses on human nature as the driver of state 
behavior, while Waltz’s neorealism (or structural realism) emphasizes the international system's structure as 
the primary determinant of state actions. 

Classical realism, as articulated by Hans J. Morgenthau in his seminal work Politics Among Nations (1948), is 
based on the assumption that politics is governed by objective laws rooted in human nature. Morgenthau 
believed that humans are inherently selfish and power-seeking, and this drives states to pursue their national 
interests in an anarchic international system. He argued that moral considerations are often subordinated to 
the pursuit of power, and that the international system is characterized by a constant struggle for dominance.

Morgenthau’s classical realism focuses on the importance of individual state leaders and their decisions, and 
he emphasized that states act in a world where power politics prevails, making conflict inevitable. 

On the other hand, neorealism, as developed by Kenneth Waltz in Theory of International Politics (1979), shifts 
the focus away from human nature and individual state leaders to the international system itself. Waltz argued 
that the structure of the international system, defined by anarchy and the distribution of capabilities among 
states, dictates state behavior. Unlike Morgenthau, who saw power in broad, multifaceted terms, Waltz 
viewed power as relative capabilities that determine a state's position in the international system. Neorealism 
is thus more systemic, emphasizing the pressures exerted by the anarchic system on states to maximize 
security and balance against threats. Waltz contended that states, as rational actors, act primarily to ensure 
their survival, which leads to predictable patterns of behavior such as balancing and bandwagoning. 

The question of which approach is best suited for analyzing international relations after the Cold War can be 
debated. Neorealism has been particularly influential in explaining post-Cold War dynamics, especially in a 
unipolar world where the United States emerged as the dominant power. Waltz’s emphasis on the structure 
of the international system helps to explain how states responded to U.S. hegemony, with theories of 
balancing and power transition coming into play. Neorealism also provides insights into the behavior of rising 
powers like China, which are seen to challenge the existing power structure. 

However, classical realism can also offer valuable insights, especially when considering the role of leadership 
and ideology in post-Cold War conflicts, such as the rise of populism and nationalism in global politics. 
Morgenthau’s emphasis on the role of human nature and the moral dilemmas of power politics can be useful 
for understanding contemporary leaders’ actions in unpredictable conflicts, such as the war in Iraq or Russia’s 
annexation of Crimea. 

While both approaches offer valuable insights, neorealism is better suited for analyzing the broader structural 
shifts and power transitions that have characterized international relations since the Cold War. However, 
classical realism still holds relevance for understanding the role of individual decision-making and human 
nature in international politics. Both perspectives continue to complement each other in analyzing the 
complexities of global power dynamics.

State-centric worldviews are rooted in the belief that the state is the primary and most important actor in 
international relations, and that its sovereignty, territorial integrity, and self-determination are paramount. 
This perspective is anchored in the principles of realism, which emphasizes the centrality of the state, national 
interest, and the anarchic nature of the international system. The key principles of state-centric worldviews 
have been shaped by scholars such as Hans Morgenthau, Kenneth Waltz, and others within the realist and 
neo-realist schools of thought. 

One of the foundational principles of state-centric worldviews is state sovereignty. According to the 
Westphalian model established in 1648, sovereignty is the concept that each state has authority over its 
territory and domestic affairs, free from external interference. As Morgenthau articulates in Politics Among 
Nations (1948), sovereignty is the cornerstone of international politics, where states seek to preserve their 
autonomy in an international system marked by competition. The state's role as the final arbiter of law and 
authority within its borders is seen as sacrosanct, and violations of this principle, such as external intervention, 
are considered threats to the global order. 

Another key principle is national interest. Realists argue that the primary goal of the state is to ensure its own 
survival and security in a world where no overarching authority can enforce rules. Kenneth Waltz, in Theory of 
International Politics (1979), introduced the concept of structural realism, where the international system is 
anarchic, meaning that states must rely on self-help to protect their interests. This often leads to power politics 
and balance-of-power strategies, where states seek to enhance their power to deter threats or maintain 
equilibrium. For example, during the Cold War, the United States and the Soviet Union engaged in an intense 
arms race to maintain the balance of power, driven by the desire to protect their national interests. 

Territorial integrity is another core principle of state-centric views. States are defined by their territorial 
boundaries, and maintaining these borders is seen as essential to statehood. Violations of territorial integrity, 
such as invasion or annexation by other states, are viewed as significant threats to the global order. This 
principle was tested during the 1990 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, which led to a global outcry and military 
intervention by a U.S.-led coalition to restore Kuwait’s territorial sovereignty. 

The principle of non-intervention is also central to state-centric worldviews. It reflects the idea that states 
should not interfere in the internal affairs of other states. This principle is enshrined in the United Nations 
Charter (Article 2, Section 7), which underscores respect for the sovereignty and domestic jurisdiction of 
states. However, the rise of humanitarian interventions and the Responsibility to Protect (R2P) doctrine 
challenges this principle, showing tension within the state-centric model when global norms confront state 
sovereignty. 

The major principles of state-centric worldviews—state sovereignty, national interest, territorial integrity, and 
non-intervention—continue to shape the way states interact in the international system. While globalization 
and transnational issues like climate change and human rights have challenged these ideas, state-centric 
principles remain fundamental to understanding international relations in a world where the state is still the 
primary actor.

Introduction:  
• Introduce Realism’s intellectual roots in the writings of thinkers who emphasized power, self-interest, 

and anarchy in international politics. 
Body:  
• Discuss key precursors like Thucydides, Machiavelli, Hobbes, and Clausewitz, who laid the groundwork 

for Realism by highlighting power struggles, state survival, and the anarchic nature of politics. 
Conclusion:  
• Conclude that these thinkers shaped modern Realist theory, contributing lasting insights on power, 

conflict, and state behavior in international relations. 
 
Realism, as a dominant theory in international relations, finds its intellectual precursors in the writings of key 
thinkers throughout history who emphasized the centrality of power, self-interest, and the anarchic nature of 
international politics. These thinkers, spanning from ancient to early modern times, laid the foundational 
principles of Realism long before it was formally developed as a theory in the 20th century. 

One of the earliest intellectual precursors of Realism is the ancient Greek historian Thucydides. In his work The 
History of the Peloponnesian War, Thucydides documented the conflict between Athens and Sparta, 
highlighting how fear, self-interest, and power drive state behavior. He famously wrote, “the strong do what 
they can and the weak suffer what they must,” encapsulating the Realist belief that international politics is 
governed by power struggles rather than ideals of justice or morality. Thucydides’ emphasis on the anarchic 
structure of the international system, where there is no overarching authority to enforce rules, is a core 
principle of modern Realism. 

Another significant intellectual precursor is Niccolò Machiavelli, whose work The Prince (1513) is a cornerstone 
of Realist thought. Machiavelli argued that rulers must prioritize the survival and security of the state above 
all else, often by using cunning, deception, and, if necessary, cruelty. He dismissed the notion that rulers could 
govern based on moral principles alone, asserting that “the ends justify the means.” Machiavelli’s pragmatic 
view of politics, focusing on power and self-interest rather than ethics, strongly influenced Realist thinkers in 
international relations. 

Thomas Hobbes, a 17th-century English philosopher, further contributed to Realism through his conception of 
human nature and the state of nature in Leviathan (1651). Hobbes described the state of nature as a condition 
of perpetual conflict, where life is “solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short” due to the absence of a higher 
authority to maintain order. This notion of anarchy, where each individual (or state) must fend for itself, closely 
mirrors the Realist view of international relations, where states operate in an anarchic international system, 
driven by the need for survival and security. 

Moving into the early modern period, Carl von Clausewitz, a Prussian military theorist, also influenced Realist 
thinking with his work On War (1832). Clausewitz emphasized that war is a continuation of politics by other 
means, reflecting the Realist belief that military power and conflict are inevitable aspects of international 
relations. 

The intellectual precursors of Realism—Thucydides, Machiavelli, Hobbes, and Clausewitz—contributed core 
ideas about power, self-interest, anarchy, and conflict that are foundational to modern Realist theory. Their

insights into the nature of human behavior and the dynamics of political power continue to shape the Realist 
understanding of international relations, where the struggle for power and security remains central. 

 
Q.10) What is ‘complex interdependence’? Discuss the role of transnational actors in the international system. 

(2021) (15 Marks) 
 

Approach to write the answer 

 
Introduction:  
• Define complex interdependence, introduce Robert Keohane and Joseph Nye’s contribution, and how 

it contrasts with traditional realism in international relations. 
Body:  
• Explain the key characteristics of complex interdependence (multiple channels, no hierarchy among 

issues, reduced role of military force), and illustrate with examples of MNCs, NGOs, and international 
organizations shaping global policy. 

Conclusion:  
• Summarize how complex interdependence highlights the role of non-state actors and the increasing 

significance of global cooperation in an interconnected world. 
 
The concept of "complex interdependence" was introduced by Robert Keohane and Joseph Nye in their 
seminal work Power and Interdependence (1977). It challenges the traditional realist view of international 
relations, which focuses primarily on state-centric power politics and military force. Complex interdependence 
suggests that, in an increasingly interconnected world, states and non-state actors are linked by multiple 
channels of communication and interaction—ranging from economic, environmental, and technological 
exchanges to social and cultural connections. These interactions diminish the utility of military power, elevate 
the importance of economic and social cooperation, and increase the role of transnational actors in shaping 
global affairs. 

Complex interdependence is characterized by three primary features. First, there are multiple channels of 
interaction between states, including government-to-government, business-to-business, and people-to-
people networks. Second, there is no hierarchy among issues; military security is no longer the dominant 
concern, as economic, environmental, and social issues become equally important. Third, the use of military 
force is significantly less effective in resolving disputes, as cooperation and negotiation become the primary 
means of managing international relations. 

In this context, transnational actors—such as multinational corporations (MNCs), non-governmental 
organizations (NGOs), and international organizations—play a critical role in the international system. These 
actors operate across national borders, shaping policy agendas, influencing governments, and facilitating 
cooperation among states. For instance, multinational corporations like Apple and Google wield significant 
economic power and influence global supply chains, impacting both domestic and international economic 
policies. According to a report by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), MNCs 
account for about one-third of global output and two-thirds of world trade, illustrating their immense 
influence in the global economy.

NGOs also play a crucial role in promoting human rights, environmental protection, and social justice. 
Organizations such as Amnesty International and Greenpeace work independently of states but exert pressure 
on governments and international institutions to adopt policies aligned with their goals. For example, 
Greenpeace's campaigns against climate change have led to greater awareness and action on environmental 
issues, influencing international agreements like the Paris Climate Accord. 

International organizations like the United Nations (UN) and the World Trade Organization (WTO) further 
exemplify complex interdependence by facilitating cooperation among states on issues like global trade, 
peacekeeping, and public health. The World Health Organization (WHO), for instance, played a key role in 
coordinating the global response to the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Complex interdependence highlights the growing importance of non-state actors and the shift away from a 
purely state-centric international system. Transnational actors, including MNCs, NGOs, and international 
organizations, are increasingly shaping global policies, promoting cooperation, and addressing transnational 
challenges in an interconnected world. This evolving dynamic reflects the broader trend of globalization, 
where power and influence are dispersed among various actors beyond the traditional nation-state 
framework. 

 
Q.11) What are the core assumptions of idealism as an approach to study International Relations? Explain its 

continuing relevance in peace building. (2020) (10 Marks) 
 

Approach to write the answer 

 
Introduction:  
• Introduce idealism as an approach in International Relations that emphasizes cooperation, moral 

values, and legal norms to achieve global peace, associated with Woodrow Wilson’s post-World War I 
vision. 

Body:  
• Explain core assumptions like human progress, diplomacy, and the role of international institutions in 

promoting peace, highlighting examples like the League of Nations and contemporary peacekeeping 
efforts. 

Conclusion:  
• Emphasize that while idealism faces criticism, its focus on dialogue, global cooperation, and ethical 

norms remains central to modern peace-building and justice efforts. 
 
Idealism, as an approach to the study of International Relations (IR), emerged in the aftermath of World War 
I and is grounded in the belief that international cooperation, moral values, and legal norms can create a 
peaceful and just global order. It is often associated with the work of Woodrow Wilson, whose Fourteen Points 
(1918) advocated for the creation of the League of Nations, collective security, self-determination, and the 
promotion of democracy and international law. 

The core assumptions of idealism include the belief in human progress, rationality, and the possibility of a 
peaceful international order through cooperation. Idealists assume that human nature is fundamentally good 
and that conflicts arise not from innate aggression but from poor governance, misunderstandings, and 
inadequate international structures. This view contrasts with realism, which emphasizes conflict and power

struggles. Idealists believe that international institutions, such as the United Nations, and international laws 
can mitigate conflicts by promoting dialogue, reducing misunderstandings, and holding states accountable to 
global norms. 

One of the key tenets of idealism is the faith in diplomacy and international cooperation. Idealists argue that 
nations can achieve lasting peace through multilateralism and the promotion of collective security. Wilson's 
League of Nations was an institutional attempt to embody this vision, aiming to prevent another world war 
through collective conflict resolution and the rule of law. Although the League ultimately failed, it laid the 
foundation for the United Nations, which remains a pillar of idealist thought in international relations. 

The relevance of idealism continues in contemporary peace-building efforts, particularly through international 
organizations, human rights advocacy, and global governance. Idealism emphasizes the importance of non-
state actors, such as non-governmental organizations (NGOs), in promoting peace and justice. For example, 
the International Campaign to Ban Landmines (ICBL), which led to the signing of the Mine Ban Treaty in 1997, 
reflects idealist principles by mobilizing global civil society to shape international norms. 

Furthermore, the success of peacekeeping missions and international courts, such as the International 
Criminal Court (ICC), also highlights idealism’s ongoing relevance. Idealists argue that these institutions play a 
critical role in enforcing international laws and norms, holding violators accountable, and fostering 
reconciliation in post-conflict societies. The UN’s peacekeeping missions in Sierra Leone and Liberia, for 
instance, are examples where international cooperation, dialogue, and institution-building played key roles in 
restoring peace. 

Idealism’s core assumptions—faith in human progress, international cooperation, and the transformative 
power of law—continue to play an essential role in shaping modern peace-building efforts. Though idealism 
faces criticism for its perceived naivety, its emphasis on dialogue, international institutions, and ethical norms 
remains central to the pursuit of global peace and justice.

interconnected, interdependent world. The Billiard Ball model, rooted in classical realism, conceptualized 
states as independent, solid entities that interact with each other like billiard balls, with little concern for what 
happens within each state. This model, famously championed by scholars like Hans Morgenthau, emphasized 
national sovereignty, territorial integrity, and military power as the key drivers of international relations. 

Several factors have contributed to the shift toward the Cobweb model, which emphasizes complex 
interdependence, as proposed by scholars Robert Keohane and Joseph Nye in their seminal work Power and 
Interdependence (1977). In the Cobweb model, states are interconnected through multiple channels—
economic, social, environmental, and political—and are affected by a vast network of non-state actors, 
transnational institutions, and global markets. 

One major factor driving this transformation is globalization, which has blurred traditional boundaries 
between states. Economic interdependence, facilitated by the rise of multinational corporations, international 
trade, and technological advancements, has made it increasingly difficult for any single state to act 
independently. Data from the World Trade Organization (WTO) shows that global trade has grown 
exponentially, increasing by over 1,000% from 1950 to 2020, reflecting the deepening economic ties between 
nations. This interdependence means that decisions made in one country, such as financial crises or trade 
policies, can have ripple effects across the global economy, as seen in the 2008 financial crisis. 

Another key factor is the rise of international organizations and institutions. The United Nations, World Bank, 
International Monetary Fund (IMF), and other global bodies play an essential role in shaping international 
norms and addressing collective challenges like climate change, security, and human rights. The Paris 
Agreement on climate change, for instance, illustrates how states and non-state actors collaborate to tackle 
global challenges that no single nation can solve alone. 

Additionally, the rise of non-state actors, including non-governmental organizations (NGOs), transnational 
corporations, and international terrorist organizations, further underscores the shift toward the Cobweb 
model. These actors influence global policy-making, security, and economic relations, weakening the 
traditional sovereignty-based framework. 

The gradual shift from the Billiard Ball model to the Cobweb model is driven by globalization, economic 
interdependence, international institutions, and the growing influence of non-state actors, reflecting the 
complexity and interconnectedness of the modern world.

• Conclude by highlighting the effectiveness of Functionalism in creating interdependence and stability, 
despite criticisms from Realists. 

 
Functionalism, as a theory in international relations, emphasizes that building peace is a gradual process 
achieved through cooperation in specific functional areas rather than through grand, top-down political 
agreements. The core idea of Functionalism, developed by scholars such as David Mitrany in the mid-20th 
century, is that international peace can be built "piece by piece" by fostering cooperation among states on 
non-political, technical issues like economics, public health, and environmental management. This bottom-up 
approach focuses on solving practical problems that transcend national borders, thereby fostering 
interdependence and reducing the likelihood of conflict. 

Mitrany’s work, A Working Peace System (1943), laid the foundation for Functionalism by arguing that instead 
of pursuing political integration directly, states should first cooperate on technical and economic functions. As 
states collaborate in specific sectors, their interests become intertwined, making war less likely because the 
cost of disrupting mutually beneficial arrangements becomes too high. For example, cooperation in sectors 
such as energy, transportation, or communications creates a network of shared interests that gradually builds 
trust and reduces the impetus for conflict. 

The post-World War II creation of institutions like the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) in 1951 is a 
prime example of Functionalism in practice. The ECSC, designed to regulate coal and steel production among 
European countries, was established to bind the economies of former enemies like France and Germany, 
making future wars between them less likely. This form of economic interdependence is often cited as one of 
the key factors that contributed to long-term peace in Europe, eventually leading to the creation of the 
European Union. 

Functionalism also finds its application in global organizations like the World Health Organization (WHO) and 
the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which focus on specific areas of international concern—public health 
and global finance, respectively. By addressing global challenges through technical cooperation and neutral 
expertise, these organizations help prevent conflicts that might arise from competition over resources or 
economic instability. For instance, the WHO’s coordination during the global response to diseases like 
HIV/AIDS or COVID-19 highlights how functional cooperation on health issues can bring countries together for 
collective action. 

Critics of Functionalism, such as Realist scholars, argue that it underestimates the importance of political 
power and state sovereignty, as economic and technical cooperation alone cannot resolve deeper political 
and military conflicts. However, Functionalists maintain that by gradually building cooperative structures, 
states can create a more stable and peaceful international order. 

Functionalism proposes that peace is best built "by pieces," through collaboration on technical and economic 
issues that progressively foster trust and interdependence among states. While not a panacea, this approach 
has proven effective in certain contexts, such as post-war Europe, and continues to play a role in global 
governance through specialized international institutions.

Introduction:  
• Introduce the commonalities between Marxist and Realist approaches in analyzing power, conflict, and 

material factors in international politics. 
Body:  
• Discuss their shared rejection of idealism, focus on material factors like power and economics, and view 

of conflict as inevitable in international relations. 
Conclusion:  
• Conclude by highlighting how both theories emphasize structural forces and power dynamics, despite 

their differing philosophical foundations. 
 
Both the Marxist and Realist approaches to the study of international politics, while rooted in different 
philosophical traditions, share certain commonalities in their analysis of power, conflict, and the structure of 
the international system. These commonalities revolve around a skeptical view of idealism, an emphasis on 
material factors in determining state behavior, and the centrality of power and conflict in shaping international 
relations. 

One of the most significant commonalities between Marxism and Realism is their shared rejection of idealism 
and liberalism in international relations. Both schools of thought critique liberal views that emphasize 
cooperation, international institutions, and moral norms as primary drivers of state behavior. For Realists, 
international relations are governed by an anarchic system where states, driven by self-interest and survival, 
act to maximize their power. Similarly, Marxists argue that international politics is shaped by material 
interests, particularly those of the capitalist class, which seeks to perpetuate its dominance through 
imperialism and economic exploitation. Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels critiqued idealist notions of 
international harmony, arguing that capitalist states are inherently expansionist and conflict-driven, much like 
Realism's perspective on power competition among states. 

Another commonality is the focus on material factors in shaping international politics. For Realists, material 
capabilities, especially military and economic power, are fundamental to understanding state behavior. Hans 
Morgenthau, a leading Realist scholar, argued that "international politics, like all politics, is a struggle for 
power." In a similar vein, Marxism emphasizes the role of economic structures in driving international conflict. 
Marxist thinkers like Vladimir Lenin in Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism argued that global 
capitalism leads to competition among capitalist states for resources and markets, resulting in imperialist 
conflicts. Both approaches, therefore, prioritize material power and resources in their analyses, whether 
through military might or economic forces. 

Additionally, both Marxism and Realism view conflict as an inevitable feature of international politics. Realists 
believe that states are in a constant struggle for power due to the anarchic international system, leading to 
frequent wars and conflicts. Similarly, Marxists see international relations as marked by class struggle, where 
the capitalist class of powerful states exploits weaker, peripheral states, leading to conflict between the 
capitalist core and the exploited periphery. For example, the Marxist interpretation of World War I views it as 
a conflict driven by imperialist competition among capitalist powers, paralleling Realist interpretations that 
emphasize power politics and national interest.

Despite their differences in philosophical underpinnings—Realism being focused on the state and anarchy, 
and Marxism on class and economic exploitation—both approaches share commonalities in their emphasis on 
material factors, skepticism of idealism, and recognition of conflict as inherent to international politics. These 
shared perspectives highlight the structural and power-driven nature of the international system according to 
both Realism and Marxism. 

 
Q.15) “Marxist approach to the study of international relations has lost its relevance in the post-cold war era.” 

Comment. (2021) (10 Marks) 
 

Approach to write the answer 

 
Introduction:  
• Introduce the debate over the relevance of the Marxist approach in international relations after the 

Cold War. 
Body:  
• Discuss how Marxism explains global inequality, neo-imperialism, and economic exploitation, even as 

liberalism and capitalism dominate. 
Conclusion:  
• Conclude by emphasizing that despite losing ideological prominence, Marxism remains valuable for 

understanding structural imbalances in the global system. 
 
The relevance of the Marxist approach to the study of international relations in the post-Cold War era has 
been debated among scholars, with some arguing that it has lost its significance due to the global shift toward 
liberalism and capitalism. However, others contend that Marxism remains a valuable framework for analyzing 
global inequality, neo-imperialism, and the structural imbalances in the international system, which persist 
even after the collapse of the Soviet Union. 

The Marxist approach to international relations, rooted in Karl Marx’s critique of capitalism, emphasizes the 
role of economic structures, class relations, and imperialism in shaping global politics. Key Marxist scholars 
like Vladimir Lenin and Immanuel Wallerstein extended this analysis to the international arena. Lenin’s theory 
of imperialism argued that capitalism, in its advanced stage, leads to global economic exploitation by powerful 
capitalist states, creating a divide between the core (wealthy, industrialized countries) and the periphery 
(developing nations). Wallerstein’s World Systems Theory further built on this by emphasizing the global 
capitalist system's hierarchical nature, where core nations exploit peripheral and semi-peripheral nations for 
economic gain. 

In the post-Cold War era, with the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the triumph of liberal democracy and 
capitalism, the relevance of Marxist theory has been questioned. Francis Fukuyama’s famous "End of History" 
thesis (1989) argued that liberal democracy had emerged as the final form of government, signaling the 
ideological defeat of Marxism. The global spread of free markets, the rise of international institutions 
promoting neoliberal policies, and the dominance of Western liberal values seemed to undermine the Marxist 
critique of capitalism and class struggle as a central lens for understanding international relations. 

However, despite this ideological shift, Marxist analysis remains relevant in explaining the persistence of 
global inequality and economic exploitation. Even after the Cold War, economic disparity between the Global

North and South continues to grow, with capitalist globalization benefiting wealthy nations and multinational 
corporations at the expense of poorer countries. Scholars like David Harvey argue that neo-imperialism and 
the exploitation of developing countries for labor, resources, and markets continue to reflect the dynamics 
Marx highlighted, where economic power dictates international relations. 

Moreover, in analyzing phenomena such as the 2008 global financial crisis, the rise of multinational 
corporations, and the expansion of neoliberal policies, Marxist theory provides valuable insights. The global 
financial system, dominated by capitalist interests, has contributed to financial instability and increasing 
inequality, reinforcing the idea that the Marxist critique of capitalism remains relevant. For example, 
Wallerstein’s World Systems Theory helps explain the marginalization of developing nations in global trade 
and finance, where wealth remains concentrated in a few powerful states and economic elites. 

While the Marxist approach may have lost some of its ideological prominence in the post-Cold War era, it 
continues to offer a valuable framework for understanding the persistence of global inequality, economic 
exploitation, and the structural imbalances that characterize the world order. The analysis of neo-imperialism, 
global capitalism, and class relations in international relations suggests that Marxist thought remains relevant 
in the contemporary era, especially in addressing the underlying economic forces shaping global politics.

Introduction:  
• Introduce the Marxist approach as a critical lens focusing on economic structures, class struggle, and 

capitalism's influence on international relations. 
Body:  
• Discuss key concepts like imperialism, global capitalism, and institutional hegemony, highlighting how 

Marxism explains global inequality and exploitation. 
Conclusion:  
• Conclude by emphasizing that Marxism critiques the global capitalist system, offering insights into 

power imbalances and inequalities in contemporary international relations. 
 
The Marxist approach to international relations provides a critical lens through which global politics is 
understood primarily in terms of economic structures, class struggle, and the exploitation inherent in the 
capitalist system. Rooted in the works of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, Marxism focuses on the dynamics of 
capitalism and its influence on international relations, viewing the state as a tool of the ruling capitalist class. 
In contemporary international relations, Marxist theories emphasize the role of global capitalism, imperialism, 
and economic inequality in shaping the interactions between states. 

One of the core tenets of the Marxist approach is the concept of imperialism, as outlined by Vladimir Lenin in 
his seminal work Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism (1917). Lenin argued that capitalism, in its 
advanced stage, drives powerful capitalist nations to expand their economic and political influence over less 
developed countries to secure new markets, resources, and cheap labor. This results in a system of economic 
exploitation, where wealthy capitalist countries dominate poorer nations, perpetuating global inequality. In 
today’s context, Marxist scholars see institutions like the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank

PSIR by Vivek Waghmare  

 

as tools of this neo-imperialist system, imposing austerity measures and structural adjustments on developing 
countries that serve the interests of global capital rather than promoting equitable development. 

Another important contribution of Marxism to contemporary international relations is the focus on global 
capitalism and its transnational nature. The rise of multinational corporations (MNCs) and the integration of 
global markets through neoliberal policies have intensified economic interdependence. Marxists argue that 
this process benefits the capitalist class, both in the core capitalist states and within the periphery, while 
exacerbating economic disparities. Scholars like Immanuel Wallerstein, through his World-Systems Theory 
(1974), categorize countries into core, semi-periphery, and periphery nations, where core countries exploit 
periphery nations for raw materials and cheap labor, reinforcing an unequal global system. This framework 
explains why poorer countries often struggle to develop, as they are systematically integrated into the 
capitalist world economy in a subordinate position. 

The Marxist critique of international institutions further reflects how these bodies reinforce capitalist 
hegemony. Antonio Gramsci’s notion of cultural hegemony explains how dominant capitalist ideologies shape 
global governance structures to reflect the interests of powerful states and corporate elites. Institutions like 
the United Nations (UN) and the World Trade Organization (WTO), while promoting global cooperation, are 
seen by Marxists as forums where the global capitalist class maintains its dominance under the guise of 
international law and order. 

In contemporary global issues such as climate change, the Marxist approach highlights the link between 
environmental degradation and capitalism’s inherent need for constant growth and profit maximization. The 
Global North’s disproportionate contribution to environmental damage and the Global South’s vulnerability 
to climate change illustrate the economic exploitation and inequalities that Marxist theory addresses. 

The Marxist approach explains contemporary international relations as a product of global capitalism, where 
economic exploitation, class struggle, and imperialism shape interactions between states. This perspective 
offers a critique of the global capitalist system, highlighting the inequalities and power imbalances that define 
the modern international order.

The functionalist approach to the study of international relations, developed by scholars such as David 
Mitrany, offers an alternative to traditional state-centric theories like Realism by focusing on the role of 
international institutions and cooperation. Functionalism posits that states can transcend their conflicts 
through the creation of international organizations that address common, non-political problems such as 
economic, social, and environmental issues. The core idea of functionalism is that as states cooperate in 
specific, technical areas, this cooperation will gradually spill over into broader areas of political life, leading to 
greater peace and stability. 

Mitrany, in his seminal work A Working Peace System (1943), argued that international cooperation in 
functional areas like health, transport, and communication could foster mutual trust and interdependence 
among states, reducing the likelihood of conflict. According to functionalists, the process of international 
integration would be driven by technocrats and experts rather than politicians, who are often constrained by 
national interests. The establishment of organizations such as the World Health Organization (WHO) or the 
International Labour Organization (ILO) exemplifies how functionalism works in practice, as these institutions 
manage international cooperation on non-political issues. 

A key feature of the functionalist approach is its emphasis on incremental cooperation and the creation of 
supranational institutions. Functionalists believe that by focusing on practical, technical issues, states will be 
more likely to cooperate, as these areas are less contentious than political or security-related matters. Over 
time, this cooperation could lead to the development of more complex forms of integration, as mutual 
dependence increases and the benefits of cooperation become clearer. 

One of the main strengths of functionalism is its focus on solving global problems through cooperation. In a 
world characterized by interdependence, functionalism recognizes that many challenges, such as climate 
change, pandemics, or international trade, require collective action that transcends national borders. For 
instance, the European Union (EU) can be seen as a partial realization of the functionalist vision, where 
economic cooperation has led to deeper political and social integration among member states. 

However, critics of the functionalist approach argue that it underestimates the persistence of national interests 
and the political nature of international relations. Realist scholars, such as Hans Morgenthau, argue that 
functionalism is overly optimistic about the ability of international institutions to overcome the competitive 
nature of states. They contend that states are ultimately driven by power and security concerns, which cannot 
be easily mitigated by technical cooperation. The failure of the League of Nations, despite its functionalist-
inspired attempts at fostering cooperation, is often cited as an example of the limitations of this approach. 

Moreover, the functionalist approach assumes a linear progression from technical cooperation to broader 
political integration, which does not always materialize. For example, while the EU has achieved significant 
economic integration, political integration remains incomplete and contentious, with recent challenges like 
Brexit reflecting the limits of functionalist thinking. 

While the functionalist approach offers valuable insights into the potential for international cooperation 
through specialized institutions, it faces significant limitations in addressing the underlying political and 
security concerns that dominate international relations. It is a useful framework for understanding issue-
specific cooperation but is less effective in explaining broader geopolitical dynamics and state behavior in the 
anarchic international system.

Q.18) Examine the World Systems approach as developed by Immanuel Wallerstein (2017) (15 Marks) 

 
Approach to write the answer 

 
Introduction:  
• Introduce World Systems Theory as a framework developed by Immanuel Wallerstein to analyze global 

inequality and economic relations. 
Body:  
• Explain Wallerstein’s division of the world into core, periphery, and semi-periphery, emphasizing the 

exploitative economic relationships between these regions. 
Conclusion:  
• Conclude by noting the theory’s value in understanding structural inequality in global capitalism, while 

acknowledging critiques and evolving global dynamics. 
 
Immanuel Wallerstein’s World Systems Theory offers a comprehensive framework for understanding global 
inequality and the dynamics of international economic relations. Developed in the 1970s, Wallerstein’s 
approach diverges from traditional nation-state-centered analyses by emphasizing a global system of 
economic and political relationships. In his seminal work, The Modern World-System (1974), Wallerstein 
argues that the world is structured into a single, integrated capitalist system that emerged in the 16th century 
and continues to shape global relations. 

A core feature of Wallerstein’s theory is the division of the world into three distinct regions: the core, the 
periphery, and the semi-periphery. According to Wallerstein, the core consists of developed, industrialized 
nations that dominate the global economy through technological advancements, capital accumulation, and 
political influence. Examples of core countries include the United States, Germany, and Japan. These nations 
control the lion’s share of global wealth and have a monopoly on the production of high-value goods. 

In contrast, the periphery comprises underdeveloped, primarily agrarian nations that provide raw materials 
and cheap labor to the core. Countries like many in Sub-Saharan Africa and parts of Latin America fall into this 
category. Wallerstein argues that the economic relationship between the core and the periphery is 
exploitative, as the periphery is structurally disadvantaged in the global system. Peripheral countries are 
forced to specialize in low-value industries, which perpetuates their dependence on the core and keeps them 
economically marginalized. 

The semi-periphery serves as an intermediate category, consisting of countries that exhibit characteristics of 
both the core and the periphery. Nations like Brazil, India, and South Africa, according to Wallerstein, occupy 
this zone because they have achieved a certain level of industrialization and economic development but are 
still not fully integrated into the core. The semi-periphery plays a stabilizing role in the world system by acting 
as a buffer, preventing a sharp divide between the core and the periphery. 

Wallerstein’s World Systems Theory also posits that the global capitalist system is inherently unequal and self-
perpetuating. He draws on Karl Marx’s analysis of capitalism, arguing that the system is designed to maximize 
profit for the core countries while maintaining the subordination of peripheral nations. Wallerstein’s critique 
of capitalism highlights how international trade and economic policies reinforce the structural inequality 
between the core and the periphery. For example, international trade agreements often benefit core nations

at the expense of the periphery, as seen in the unequal terms of trade for African and Latin American countries 
in global commodity markets. 

Wallerstein also extends his analysis to include political and social structures, arguing that the world system is 
sustained through a combination of economic coercion, political dominance, and ideological control. The 
global institutions, such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank, often serve the 
interests of core countries by promoting policies like structural adjustment programs that perpetuate the 
dependence of peripheral nations on core economies. 

Critics of Wallerstein’s approach argue that it is overly deterministic and underestimates the potential for 
social and political change within the periphery. Scholars like Andre Gunder Frank and Samir Amin have 
critiqued aspects of the World Systems Theory for oversimplifying the complex realities of development and 
economic transformation. Moreover, the rise of countries like China, which has transitioned from a semi-
periphery status to a dominant player in the global economy, challenges Wallerstein’s static categorization. 

Immanuel Wallerstein’s World Systems Theory provides a valuable lens for understanding global economic 
inequality by focusing on the structural relationships between core, semi-periphery, and periphery nations. 
His critique of capitalism and the global economic order highlights how historical processes and contemporary 
policies sustain this inequality, making his approach a crucial framework for analyzing international relations 
and development in a globalized world. 

 
Q.19) Critically examine the Functional and System approaches to the study of international relations. (2016) 

(15 Marks) 
 

Approach to write the answer 

 
Introduction:  
• Introduce the Functional and Systems approaches as two key frameworks for analyzing international 

relations. 
Body:  
• Explain how the Functional approach focuses on cooperation through institutions, while the Systems 

approach, influenced by Waltz, emphasizes the structure of power in an anarchic international system. 
Conclusion:  
• Conclude by highlighting the insights and limitations of both approaches, suggesting the need for 

complementary perspectives to fully understand global politics. 
 
The Functional and System approaches are two important frameworks used in the study of international 
relations (IR), each offering distinct perspectives on how to analyze global politics. These approaches emerged 
during the mid-20th century as scholars sought to move beyond traditional state-centric and power-focused 
models, such as realism, to better understand the complexities of international interactions. 

Functional Approach 

The functional approach, pioneered by David Mitrany in his work A Working Peace System (1943), emphasizes 
the role of international organizations and institutions in addressing global issues. Mitrany argued that

cooperation among states could be built through functional institutions focused on specific problems, such as 
health, trade, or environmental issues, rather than through political or military alliances. He believed that 
functional cooperation in non-political areas would lead to a spillover effect, gradually expanding into more 
significant forms of collaboration and reducing the likelihood of conflict between states. 

One of the key concepts in the functional approach is the idea of “technical” or “functional” cooperation, 
where states collaborate on solving practical problems without necessarily addressing contentious political 
issues. For example, the formation of the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) in 1951, which later 
evolved into the European Union (EU), is a successful application of functionalism. The ECSC was created to 
regulate coal and steel production between France and Germany, fostering economic cooperation and 
reducing the chances of war. 

However, the functional approach has its limitations. Critics argue that it underestimates the role of political 
conflicts and power struggles in international relations. The approach assumes that cooperation in technical 
areas will automatically lead to broader political integration, which is not always the case. The rise of populism 
and the Brexit vote in the UK reflect the limits of functionalist integration when political and cultural issues 
take precedence over economic cooperation. 

Systems Approach 

The systems approach, influenced by Kenneth Waltz’s Theory of International Politics (1979), views the 
international system as an anarchic structure where the behavior of states is shaped by the distribution of 
power. The systems approach adopts a holistic view, analyzing international relations as an interconnected 
system where the actions of one state can influence the entire system. Waltz’s neorealism, or structural 
realism, argues that the international system is characterized by anarchy, meaning no overarching authority 
exists above states, forcing them to act in self-interest for survival. 

The systems approach also emphasizes the importance of polarity—whether the international system is 
unipolar, bipolar, or multipolar—in determining the behavior of states. For example, during the Cold War, the 
bipolar system of U.S.-Soviet rivalry shaped international relations, with smaller states aligning with one of the 
two superpowers. The end of the Cold War and the emergence of a unipolar world, with the U.S. as the 
dominant power, shifted the dynamics of the international system once again. 

However, the systems approach has been criticized for being overly deterministic. By focusing on the structure 
of the international system, it tends to downplay the role of domestic politics, leadership, and agency in 
shaping state behavior. Critics also argue that it is too rigid, unable to account for the influence of non-state 
actors, such as multinational corporations and transnational organizations, which play an increasingly 
important role in global politics. 

The functional and systems approaches offer valuable insights into the study of international relations but 
have distinct limitations. The functional approach highlights the potential for cooperation through 
international institutions but may underestimate the role of politics and conflict. The systems approach 
provides a structural analysis of global power dynamics but can be overly deterministic and neglect the agency 
of states and non-state actors. Together, these approaches contribute to a more comprehensive 
understanding of international relations, though they must be complemented by other perspectives to 
address their shortcomings.

Q.20) Mortan A Kaplan’s system theory is contrary to the fundamental precepts of the Systems approach. 

Comment. (2014) (15 Marks) 
 

Approach to write the answer 

 
Introduction:  
• Introduce Kaplan's system theory as a departure from traditional systems approaches in international 

relations. 
Body:  
• Explain Kaplan’s focus on states as dynamic actors influenced by human agency, contrasting it with the 

deterministic nature of structural analysis in traditional systems theory. 
Conclusion:  
• Conclude by highlighting how Kaplan's approach adds nuance to international relations by emphasizing 

fluidity, decision-making, and the role of agency in shaping global politics. 
 
Morton A. Kaplan's system theory, particularly articulated in his work The International System: A Theoretical 
Analysis, presents a framework that departs significantly from the traditional systems approach in 
international relations. The systems approach generally emphasizes the interdependence of various 
components within a system, focusing on how these elements interact to produce overall behavior and 
outcomes. However, Kaplan's theory introduces a more dynamic and fluid conception of systems, challenging 
some of the fundamental precepts of the systems approach. 

One key difference lies in Kaplan's view of states as rational actors within a competitive environment. While 
the systems approach tends to treat states as stable entities interacting in a relatively predictable manner, 
Kaplan posits that the international system is characterized by constant change and adaptation. He argues 
that "the behavior of states is not merely a function of their positions within a fixed structure but is also 
influenced by their perceptions and decisions." This perspective implies that the actions of states can lead to 
systemic changes, making the international system less predictable and more complex. 

Kaplan's emphasis on the importance of human agency contrasts sharply with the systems approach's focus 
on structural factors. He believes that the decisions made by leaders, influenced by historical contexts and 
personal beliefs, can significantly alter the dynamics of international relations. For instance, Kaplan suggests 
that the Cold War's outcomes were shaped not only by the structural balance of power but also by the unique 
choices made by key leaders like Ronald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev. This focus on agency highlights the 
limitations of a purely systemic analysis, which may overlook the nuances of individual decision-making and 
its impact on international dynamics. 

Moreover, Kaplan critiques the systems approach for its often deterministic nature, which can imply a level of 
inevitability in state behavior based on structural conditions. He argues that this perspective can lead to a 
fatalistic understanding of international relations, where outcomes seem preordained by systemic factors. In 
contrast, Kaplan's theory suggests that the international system is more fluid and contingent, allowing for the 
possibility of change driven by human action and interaction.

Morton A. Kaplan's system theory stands in contrast to the fundamental precepts of the systems approach by 
emphasizing the fluidity of the international system, the significance of human agency, and the limitations of 
deterministic analyses. By focusing on the dynamic interplay between states and the impact of individual 
decision-making, Kaplan provides a more nuanced understanding of international relations that recognizes 
the complexities inherent in global politics. This approach invites scholars to consider not only the structures 
that shape behavior but also the agency that drives change within the international system. 

 
Q.21) Explain the central tenets of the World-Systems Theory. Comment. (2024) (10 Marks) 

 
Approach to write the answer 

 
Introduction:  
• Introduce World-Systems Theory as a framework developed by Immanuel Wallerstein to understand 

global inequality through an integrated world economy. 
Body:  
• Explain the division of the world into core, semi-periphery, and periphery, focusing on how this 

structure perpetuates inequality and economic exploitation. 
Conclusion:  
• Conclude by noting the theory's value in analyzing global inequalities, while acknowledging critiques 

that it underestimates potential shifts in global power, such as the rise of China. 
 
World-Systems Theory, developed by sociologist Immanuel Wallerstein in the 1970s, provides a 
comprehensive framework for understanding global inequality, economic development, and international 
relations. It challenges the traditional nation-state perspective by analyzing the world economy as a complex, 
integrated system. The theory’s central tenets focus on the global division of labor, the historical evolution of 
capitalism, and the hierarchical structure of the world system, which is divided into core, semi-periphery, and 
periphery regions. 

The first core idea of World-Systems Theory is the notion of a single world economy, with capitalism as its 
driving force. Wallerstein argues that since the 16th century, the world has been organized into a capitalist 
world economy, where production, trade, and wealth are interconnected across national borders. This global 
system is marked by economic and political inequalities that shape the relationships between nations. Unlike 
other development theories that view each country’s development trajectory in isolation, World-Systems 
Theory emphasizes the interconnectedness of countries, where the fate of one nation is dependent on its 
position in the global system. 

A key tenet of the theory is the division of the world into three categories: the core, the semi-periphery, and 
the periphery. Core countries, such as the U.S., Japan, and Western European nations, are economically 
dominant, technologically advanced, and politically powerful. They benefit from the global system by 
exploiting the labor and resources of the periphery, which includes less developed nations in regions like 
Africa, Latin America, and parts of Asia. The semi-periphery occupies a middle position, with countries such as 
Brazil, India, and South Africa, which are industrializing but still subjected to the influence of the core. 

This hierarchical structure creates an unequal exchange, where core countries extract raw materials and cheap 
labor from the periphery while exporting finished goods at higher prices. Wallerstein explains that this division

of labor is self-reinforcing, as core nations maintain their dominance through military power, economic 
agreements, and control over global institutions like the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World 
Bank. For example, the extraction of oil from Nigeria by multinational corporations exemplifies how peripheral 
nations provide raw materials while receiving limited benefits from the global economy. 

Critics of World-Systems Theory, such as Andre Gunder Frank and Samir Amin, argue that the theory 
underemphasizes the agency of peripheral states and fails to account for the dynamic shifts in global power. 
For instance, the rise of China challenges the static notion of core-periphery relations, as China transitions 
from a semi-peripheral to a core-like status. 

World-Systems Theory offers a critical lens for understanding the persistence of global inequalities and the 
mechanisms of capitalist exploitation. However, its limitations lie in underestimating the potential for upward 
mobility within the global system, as evidenced by the economic rise of countries like China and India. 
Nonetheless, it remains a valuable tool for analyzing the global dynamics of power, wealth, and development. 

 
Q.22) Explain the various facets of the idealist approach to the study of international relations. Comment on 

its contemporary relevance. Comment. (2024) (10 Marks) 
 

Approach to write the answer 

 
Introduction:  
• Introduce the idealist approach in International Relations as a framework emphasizing ethics, 

cooperation, and the potential for peace. 
Body:  
• Explain core tenets such as collective security, the promotion of democracy, and the role of 

international institutions, highlighting key examples like Wilson's Fourteen Points and the UN. 
Conclusion:  
• Conclude by acknowledging the criticisms of idealism for its optimism while reaffirming its relevance in 

addressing contemporary global challenges. 
 
The idealist approach in International Relations (IR) emphasizes the role of ethics, morality, and international 
cooperation in promoting peace and stability. Rooted in the liberal tradition, idealism gained prominence after 
World War I with scholars like Woodrow Wilson advocating for international governance structures such as 
the League of Nations. Idealists believe that human nature is fundamentally good and that war and conflict 
are not inevitable. Instead, they argue that the international system can be reformed through institutions, 
diplomacy, and legal frameworks to promote peace and cooperation. The core tenets of the idealist approach 
revolve around the ideas of collective security, international law, disarmament, and the spread of democracy. 

Woodrow Wilson's Fourteen Points (1918) exemplify the idealist vision for international relations. Wilson 
argued that open diplomacy, self-determination, and international organizations could prevent future 
conflicts by addressing the root causes of war. The establishment of the League of Nations, though ultimately 
unsuccessful, was a landmark effort in institutionalizing cooperation and collective security on a global scale. 
Idealists also place great importance on international law, believing that binding legal agreements and 
multilateral treaties can regulate state behavior and resolve disputes peacefully.

Another significant facet of idealism is the belief in the moral responsibility of states to promote democracy 
and human rights globally. Scholars like Immanuel Kant, in his work Perpetual Peace (1795), argued that 
democratic nations are less likely to go to war with each other, forming the basis of the "democratic peace 
theory." This idealistic principle suggests that promoting democracy worldwide is key to maintaining peace. 

In contemporary times, idealism continues to influence global politics, particularly in the form of international 
institutions like the United Nations (UN), which reflects the idealist belief in collective security and 
international governance. The UN’s peacekeeping missions and its role in fostering international norms on 
human rights underscore the enduring relevance of idealist principles. Similarly, global agreements such as 
the Paris Climate Accord reflect idealist thinking by addressing shared challenges through collective action. 

However, idealism is often criticized for being overly optimistic and underestimating the role of power and 
self-interest in international politics. The failures of the League of Nations and the challenges facing the UN 
show the limits of idealist approaches in a world where realist forces like national interest and power politics 
continue to dominate. 

While idealism may seem idealistic in a world rife with conflict, its focus on ethical governance, democracy, 
and international cooperation remains relevant in addressing global issues like climate change, human rights, 
and collective security.
