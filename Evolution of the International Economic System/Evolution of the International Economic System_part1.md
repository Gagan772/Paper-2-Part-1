## <a id="q1"></a>Q1. Identify and evaluate the reasons for deadlock in the WTO negotiations on fisheries between the developing and developed countries. (2022) (20 Marks)

### 🎯 Core Theme
The WTO fisheries subsidies deadlock reflects conflicting priorities between developed nations (advocating strict conservation measures) and developing countries (defending livelihood security and economic survival). The impasse stems from historical responsibility debates, definitional disputes over "harmful subsidies," and demands for special and differential treatment.

### 🔑 Key Recall Terms
`WTO Fisheries Deadlock` | `Subsidy Negotiations` | `Developed vs Developing` | `Marine Resource Depletion` | `Economic Dependency` | `Overfishing` | `Small-Scale Fishing` | `Livelihood Security` | `Food Security` | `Special and Differential Treatment` | `Harmful Subsidies` | `Historical Responsibility` | `Industrial Fishing Fleets` | `Common-Pool Resources` | `Globalization Paradox` | `Equity in Conservation`

### 📝 Answer Structure

**Introduction**
- WTO fisheries subsidies negotiations highlight tension between developed and developing country interests
- Aim: limit subsidies leading to overfishing and marine resource depletion
- Stalled due to differing economic priorities, resource dependencies, and environmental responsibilities
- Developed countries push for stringent regulations to curb overfishing subsidies
- Developing nations argue restrictions threaten economic livelihoods and food security
- Small-scale fishing forms backbone of many developing economies

**Body**

*Economic Dependency of Developing Countries*
- Fisheries critical for livelihoods and food security in developing nations
- Dani Rodrik's "The Globalization Paradox" (2011): globalization pressures developing nations to adopt unsuitable standards
- Coastal and island nations (India, Indonesia, Philippines) heavily reliant on fisheries
- Fisheries provide income and employment to vulnerable coastal communities
- Strict subsidy limits disproportionately harm fishing communities in poorer nations
- Wealthier nations can transition away from subsidized fisheries more easily
- Small-scale fisheries lack capital for modernization
- Subsidies crucial for sustaining communities against competition from industrial fishing fleets
- Economic survival versus environmental conservation debate

*Imbalance of Responsibility in Marine Conservation*
- Developed countries advocate stricter controls with advanced technology and economies
- Developing countries cite historical contribution of developed nations to marine resource depletion
- Extensive industrial fishing by developed nations caused historical damage
- Elinor Ostrom's work on "Common-Pool Resources" (1990): effective management requires accounting for historical use and equity
- Burden of conservation should not fall equally on nations with different industrialization levels
- Unfair restriction on development prospects of emerging economies
- Historical justice demands differentiated responsibilities
- Equity principle in resource management

*Contested Definition and Scope of "Harmful Subsidies"*
- Developed countries identify fuel tax exemptions and fleet expansion funds as harmful
- Lead to overfishing and environmental degradation
- Developing nations argue not all subsidies are harmful
- Targeted support for small-scale fishers essential for poverty reduction
- WTO's "one-size-fits-all" approach fails to address unique needs of small-scale fisheries
- Subsistence fishing versus commercial fishing distinction
- Demand for "special and differential treatment" provisions
- Allow continuation of specific subsidies for small-scale and subsistence fishers
- Developed nations hesitant to support differentiated treatment
- Definitional ambiguity creates negotiation impasse

*Implementation and Compliance Concerns*
- Monitoring and enforcement capacity disparities
- Developing countries lack resources for complex compliance mechanisms
- Technology gap in tracking and reporting systems
- Transparency requirements may disadvantage nations with limited administrative capacity
- Need for capacity-building support from developed countries

**Conclusion**
- Deadlock reflects complex intersection of economic dependency, historical responsibility, and subsidy definitions
- Addressing impasse requires recognizing unique needs of developing countries
- Solution: allow differentiated responsibilities to balance conservation and development
- Aligns with sustainable development and equitable globalization principles
- Need for flexible framework accommodating diverse economic realities
- Path forward: special provisions for small-scale fishers while maintaining conservation goals
