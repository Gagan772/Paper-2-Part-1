### ✨ Power Conclusion
*"The interpretive approach—from Geertz's thick description to Skinner's historical contextualization to Anderson's imagined communities—rescues comparative politics from the tyranny of quantification, insisting that understanding India's democracy or nationalism's appeal requires not just counting institutions but decoding meanings, yet this cultural depth comes at the cost of generalizability, making interpretation essential complement to, rather than substitute for, empirical rigor."*
