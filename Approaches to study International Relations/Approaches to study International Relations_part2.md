  - Domestic politics
  - Leadership
  - Agency in shaping behavior
- Too rigid
- Unable to account for non-state actors
- Multinational corporations
- Transnational organizations
- Play increasingly important role
- In global politics

*Comparative Analysis:*
- **Functional:** Bottom-up, issue-specific
- **Systems:** Top-down, structural
- **Functional:** Optimistic about cooperation
- **Systems:** Pessimistic, emphasizes constraints
- **Functional:** Process-oriented
- **Systems:** Structure-oriented

**Conclusion:**
- Both offer valuable insights
- Have distinct limitations
- Functional highlights potential
- For cooperation through institutions
- May underestimate politics and conflict
- Systems provides structural analysis
- Of global power dynamics
- Can be overly deterministic
- Neglect agency of states
- Neglect non-state actors

- Framework departs significantly
- From traditional systems approach
- Systems approach generally emphasizes
- Interdependence of components
- Focus on elements' interactions
- Produce overall behavior and outcomes
- Kaplan introduces more dynamic conception
- Fluid conception of systems
- Challenges fundamental precepts
- Of systems approach

**Body:**

*Key Difference - States as Dynamic Actors:*
- Lies in Kaplan's view
- States as rational actors
- Within competitive environment
- While systems approach treats
- States as stable entities
- Interacting predictably
- Kaplan posits international system
- Characterized by constant change
- Characterized by adaptation
- Argues: "Behavior of states
- Not merely function of positions
- Within fixed structure
- Also influenced by perceptions
- Influenced by decisions"
- Perspective implies state actions
- Can lead to systemic changes
- Making system less predictable
- More complex

*Emphasis on Human Agency:*
- Kaplan's emphasis
- On importance of human agency
- Contrasts sharply with systems approach
- Focus on structural factors
- Believes decisions by leaders
- Influenced by historical contexts
- Influenced by personal beliefs
- Can significantly alter dynamics
- Of international relations

- **Cold War Example:**
  - Suggests Cold War outcomes
  - Shaped not only by structural balance
  - But also by unique choices
  - Made by key leaders
  - Ronald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev
  - Focus on agency highlights
  - Limitations of purely systemic analysis
  - May overlook nuances
  - Of individual decision-making
  - Its impact on dynamics

*Critique of Determinism:*
- Kaplan critiques systems approach
- For often deterministic nature
- Can imply level of inevitability
- In state behavior
- Based on structural conditions
- Argues perspective can lead
- To fatalistic understanding of IR
- Where outcomes seem preordained
- By systemic factors
- Contrast: Kaplan's theory suggests
- International system more fluid
- More contingent
- Allowing for possibility of change
- Driven by human action
- Driven by interaction

*Comparison of Perspectives:*
- **Traditional Systems:**
  - Structure determines behavior
  - Predictable patterns
  - Stable equilibria
  - External constraints primary
  
- **Kaplan's Theory:**
  - Behavior shapes structure
  - Unpredictable outcomes
  - Dynamic equilibria
  - Internal decisions matter

*Implications for IR Theory:*
- Kaplan's approach suggests
- Need to account for:
  - Leadership quality
  - Perceptual factors
  - Historical contingency
  - Strategic choice
- Not just structural position
- In international system

**Conclusion:**
- Kaplan's system theory
- Stands in contrast
- To fundamental precepts
- Of systems approach
- Emphasizing fluidity
- Of international system
- Significance of human agency
- Limitations of deterministic analyses
- Focusing on dynamic interplay
- Between states
- Impact of individual decision-making
- Provides more nuanced understanding
- Of international relations
- Recognizes complexities inherent
- In global politics
- Invites scholars to consider
- Not only structures shaping behavior
- But also agency driving change
- Within international system
