## <a id="q1"></a>Q1. In what ways does the functionalist approach in International relations help in maintaining peace and order in global politics? (2023) (15 Marks)

### 🎯 Core Theme
Functionalism promotes peace through technical cooperation in non-political areas, creating interdependence that gradually reduces conflict by addressing shared global challenges rather than political power struggles.

### 🔑 Key Recall Terms
`David Mitrany` | `Working Peace System` | `Spillover Effect` | `Technical Cooperation` | `ECSC` | `WHO` | `IMF` | `EU Integration` | `Paris Agreement` | `Non-political Areas` | `Interdependence` | `Peace Building`

### 📝 Answer Structure

**Introduction:**
- Functionalism emphasizes cooperation through non-political, technical, and economic institutions
- Developed by David Mitrany as alternative to power politics
- Focuses on shared interests in trade, health, environmental management
- Promotes interdependence among states to reduce conflict likelihood
- Enhances global stability through practical cooperation

**Body:**

*Mitrany's Theoretical Framework:*
- *A Working Peace System* (1943) - seminal work
- Cooperation in technical/economic spheres leads to political cooperation
- Nations working on common problems develop cooperation habits
- Problems: poverty, disease, climate change require collective action
- Conflict becomes less likely through functional integration
- Peace achieved incrementally, not through grand political agreements

*Role of International Institutions:*
- WHO addresses global health challenges
- IMF manages international financial stability
- Organizations solve problems no single state can address alone
- Foster peaceful relations through technical expertise
- Create networks of cooperation transcending political boundaries

*European Integration Example:*
- ECSC (1951) linked coal and steel production
- Economic cooperation between France and Germany
- Former rivals became integrated partners
- Evolved into broader political and economic union (EU)
- Reduced likelihood of war in Europe
- Demonstrates economic integration leading to political unity
- Validates Mitrany's vision of functional cooperation

*Global Climate Action:*
- Paris Agreement (2015) exemplifies functional cooperation
- States collaborate despite political differences
- Common challenge transcends national politics
- Fosters dialogue and reduces tensions
- Emphasizes shared goals over divisive politics
- Demonstrates transnational cooperation on functional issues

*Mechanisms of Peace Maintenance:*
- Creates mutual dependencies between states
- Builds trust through repeated cooperation
- Technical issues less contentious than political ones
- Expert-driven cooperation bypasses political conflicts
- Gradual spillover from technical to political integration

**Conclusion:**
- Functionalism maintains peace through non-political cooperation
- Creates interdependence and mutual trust among states
- Addresses shared technical/economic challenges
- Mitigates conflicts through practical problem-solving
- Contributes to long-term global stability
- Examples: EU integration, international environmental agreements

## <a id="q2"></a>Q2. What do you mean by offensive and defensive realism? (2023) (15 Marks)

### 🎯 Core Theme
Offensive and defensive realism represent two contrasting strategies within realist IR theory: offensive realism advocates aggressive power maximization for survival, while defensive realism promotes cautious balancing to avoid provoking counterbalancing threats.

### 🔑 Key Recall Terms
`John Mearsheimer` | `Kenneth Waltz` | `Tragedy of Great Power Politics` | `Structural Realism` | `Power Maximization` | `Security Maximization` | `Hegemony` | `Balance of Power` | `Anarchy` | `Self-Help` | `NATO` | `Peaceful Rise`

### 📝 Answer Structure

**Introduction:**
- Two distinct strands within realist school
- Both focus on power and security
- Differ in explanations of state behavior
- Rooted in anarchic international system framework
- No overarching authority exists to enforce rules
- States rely on self-help strategies
- Diverge on power accumulation approaches

**Body:**

*Offensive Realism - Mearsheimer's Framework:*
- Articulated in *The Tragedy of Great Power Politics* (2001)
- Anarchic system requires aggressive power strategies
- Primary goal: achieve hegemony for survival
- States never satisfied with status quo
- Constantly seek relative power over rivals
- More power = reduced threat likelihood
- "The best defense is a good offense"
- Prepared to expand influence (military, economic, diplomatic)
- Nazi Germany's 1930s expansion as example
- U.S. global dominance post-WWII
- Power maximization ensures security

*Defensive Realism - Waltz's Framework:*
- Associated with Kenneth Waltz
- *Theory of International Politics* (1979)
- States seek power primarily for security
- Not necessarily to maximize beyond necessary
- International system compels security concerns
- Excessive power accumulation provokes balancing
- Leads to greater insecurity
- System punishes hegemonic pursuit
- Triggers counterbalancing coalitions
- Cold War example: Soviet expansion → NATO
- Advocate cautious approach
- Emphasize balancing over expanding
- China's "peaceful rise" strategy exemplifies this
- Gradually increase power without alarming rivals

*Comparative Analysis:*
- Both emphasize power importance
- Offensive: maximizing power leads to security
- Defensive: warns against overreach
- State behavior reflects mix of both
- U.S. foreign policy oscillates between approaches
- Iraq invasion 2003 (offensive)
- Alliance maintenance (defensive)
- Context determines strategy adoption

**Conclusion:**
- Contrasting lenses for state behavior
- Offensive advocates power maximization
- Defensive stresses maintaining balance
- Both explain different historical actions
- Help understand contemporary global politics
- Applicable to various state strategies

## Q.2) What do you mean by offensive and defensive realism? (2023) (15 Marks)

### Approach to write the answer

**Introduction:**  
• Introduce offensive and defensive realism as two strands within the realist school of international relations, focusing on power and security in the anarchic international system.

**Body:**  
• Explain that offensive realism emphasizes aggressive power maximization for survival, while defensive realism advocates for cautious power accumulation to avoid provoking counterbalancing threats.

**Conclusion:**  
• Highlight that both theories offer contrasting views on state behavior, with offensive realism promoting power expansion and defensive realism warning against overreach, explaining various state actions.

### Answer

Offensive and defensive realism are two distinct strands within the realist school of thought in international relations, both of which focus on the role of power and security but differ in their explanations of state behavior. Both derive from the broader framework of realism, which emphasizes the anarchic structure of the international system, where no overarching authority exists to enforce rules or protect states, compelling them to rely on self-help strategies. However, offensive and defensive realism diverge in their perspectives on how states should approach power accumulation and security.

Offensive realism, as articulated by John Mearsheimer in *The Tragedy of Great Power Politics* (2001), argues that in an anarchic international system, states must pursue aggressive strategies to maximize their power. According to Mearsheimer, the primary goal of states is to achieve hegemony, as this is the best way to ensure their survival. Offensive realism posits that states are never satisfied with the status quo; they constantly seek to gain relative power over their rivals, as more power reduces the likelihood of being threatened. Mearsheimer famously argues, "The best defense is a good offense," suggesting that states must be prepared to expand their influence, whether through military, economic, or diplomatic means. Historical examples, such as Nazi Germany's aggressive expansion in the 1930s or the U.S.'s global dominance after World War II, are often cited as evidence of offensive realism in practice.

In contrast, defensive realism, primarily associated with Kenneth Waltz and his work *Theory of International Politics* (1979), contends that states seek power primarily to ensure their security, not necessarily to maximize it beyond what is necessary. Defensive realists argue that while the international system compels states to be concerned with security, excessive power accumulation can provoke balancing behavior from other states, leading to greater insecurity. Waltz's structural realism suggests that the international system punishes states that attempt to pursue hegemony because such actions invite counterbalancing coalitions, as seen during the Cold War when the Soviet Union's expansionist policies triggered alliances like NATO. Defensive realists advocate for a cautious approach, emphasizing balancing power rather than aggressively expanding it. For instance, China's "peaceful rise" strategy has been interpreted as an example of defensive realism, where the focus is on gradually increasing power without alarming rival states.

Both theories highlight the importance of power, but while offensive realism argues that maximizing power leads to security, defensive realism warns against overreach. In practice, state behavior often reflects a mix of both. The U.S.'s foreign policy, for example, has oscillated between offensive actions, such as the invasion of Iraq in 2003, and defensive strategies, like maintaining alliances to balance against potential threats.

Offensive and defensive realism provide contrasting lenses through which to view state behavior in the anarchic international system. While offensive realism advocates for power maximization, defensive realism stresses maintaining a balance to avoid provoking unnecessary conflict. Both approaches help explain different historical and contemporary state actions on the global stage.

## Q.3) What is the realist prescription to the States to ensure their survival in an anarchical world? (2022) (15 Marks)

### Approach to write the answer

**Introduction:**  
• Introduce realism as a theory in international relations that emphasizes state survival in an anarchic world without a central authority.

**Body:**  
• Explain that realism prescribes power accumulation, balancing against threats, and strategic diplomacy, with military power and alliances as key tools for state security.

**Conclusion:**  
• Highlight that realism advises states to focus on self-help and careful management of power to navigate the hostile international system and ensure survival.

### Answer

Realism, a dominant theory in international relations, offers a pragmatic and often pessimistic prescription for states to ensure their survival in an anarchical world where no central authority exists to enforce order. Realists argue that the international system is characterized by anarchy, meaning the absence of a global government, and thus states must rely on self-help to secure their interests and survival. This perspective is rooted in the works of classical realists like Hans Morgenthau, who in *Politics Among Nations* (1948) emphasized that states must prioritize national interest and power to navigate an inherently hostile international environment.

The realist prescription to ensure survival revolves around the concept of power. States are urged to maximize their military and economic capabilities to deter potential threats and dominate the international arena. Realists view power, particularly military power, as the ultimate means of ensuring security in a competitive international system. Kenneth Waltz, in his *Theory of International Politics* (1979), developed the theory of structural realism (or neorealism), which asserts that in an anarchical system, the distribution of power, especially in the form of military strength, dictates the behavior of states. Therefore, states should build and maintain robust military capabilities to defend themselves against external threats.

Another key aspect of the realist prescription is balancing power. In an anarchic world, realists suggest that states should form alliances or balance against more powerful states or coalitions to prevent any one state from becoming too dominant. For example, during the Cold War, the formation of military alliances such as NATO and the Warsaw Pact was a classic case of balancing, where states sought to maintain a power equilibrium to prevent dominance by either the United States or the Soviet Union. Waltz argued that balancing is a natural reaction for states seeking to preserve their independence and security.

Realism also emphasizes the importance of strategic diplomacy and maintaining flexibility in alliances. Realists like John Mearsheimer, in his work *The Tragedy of Great Power Politics* (2001), assert that states should be willing to shift alliances or form temporary partnerships to ensure survival. For instance, during World War II, the United States allied with the Soviet Union against Nazi Germany despite their ideological differences, illustrating the realist principle that survival and power take precedence over ideological alignment.

Despite the focus on power, realists also highlight the dangers of overextension. Morgenthau warned against "imperial overstretch," where states pursue expansive goals that outstrip their resources, leading to vulnerability. Realism, therefore, urges prudence in foreign policy decisions, cautioning against unnecessary wars or excessive ambitions that could weaken the state's security.

Realism prescribes that states should focus on accumulating power, balancing against potential threats, and practicing pragmatic diplomacy to ensure their survival in an anarchic international system. In a world without a global enforcer, survival is secured by self-help, alliances, and the careful management of power.

## Q.4) Discuss the emergence of neo-realism and its basic tenets (2021) (15 Marks)

### Approach to write the answer

**Introduction:**  
• Introduce neo-realism, or structural realism, as a response to classical realism, emphasizing the international system's structure in shaping state behavior.

**Body:**  
• Explain key tenets, such as the anarchic system, balance of power, state rationality, and relative gains, using examples like the Cold War and security dilemmas.

**Conclusion:**  
• Highlight neo-realism's impact on international relations, offering a structured analysis of global politics based on power dynamics and state security concerns.

### Answer

Neo-realism, also known as structural realism, emerged in the late 20th century as a response to the limitations of classical realism in international relations theory. Primarily associated with the works of Kenneth Waltz, particularly his 1979 book *Theory of International Politics*, neo-realism redefined the theoretical landscape by emphasizing the structure of the international system as the key determinant of state behavior rather than human nature or domestic factors.

At the heart of neo-realism is the notion that the international system is anarchic, meaning there is no overarching authority to enforce rules or maintain order among states. This anarchic structure compels states to prioritize their survival and security, leading them to act in ways that can be understood through a power-centric lens. Waltz argues that "the structure of the international system is the central influence on state behavior," asserting that it shapes the distribution of capabilities among states and subsequently determines their interactions.

One of the basic tenets of neo-realism is the concept of the balance of power. Neo-realists contend that states are motivated to maintain their security and will therefore seek to balance against more powerful states. This can manifest through internal balancing (increasing military capabilities) or external balancing (forming alliances). The Cold War period exemplifies this principle, as the United States and the Soviet Union engaged in a strategy of containment and alliance-building to counter each other's influence, leading to a bipolar world order characterized by military and ideological competition.

Another important tenet of neo-realism is the idea of state rationality and unitary actors. Neo-realists assume that states act as rational entities, making decisions based on calculations of national interest and power. This perspective simplifies the complexities of domestic politics and focuses on how states interact in pursuit of their security objectives. For example, the decisions made by nations during the Gulf War in 1990-1991 can be analyzed through a neo-realist lens, where states formed coalitions to counter Iraq's aggression based on collective security concerns.

Furthermore, neo-realism introduces the concept of relative gains, emphasizing that states are more concerned about how their power and security compare to others rather than absolute gains. This perspective often leads to security dilemmas, where the actions taken by one state to enhance its security inadvertently threaten others, prompting an arms race or escalation of tensions, as seen in the nuclear proliferation debates in South Asia.

Neo-realism has significantly shaped the field of international relations by offering a structured analysis of state behavior grounded in the anarchic nature of the international system. By focusing on power dynamics, state rationality, and the importance of balancing strategies, neo-realism provides a compelling framework for understanding the complexities of global politics in a rapidly changing world.

## Q.5) Bring out the major differences between the classical Realism of Hans Morgenthau and Neorealism of Kenneth Waltz. (2018) (10 Marks)

### Approach to write the answer

**Introduction:**  
• Introduce Classical Realism and Neorealism as two key schools in international relations, both focused on power and anarchy but differing in approach.

**Body:**  
• Explain that Classical Realism emphasizes human nature and the will to power, while Neorealism focuses on the structure of the international system and state security, with distinct views on power and morality.

**Conclusion:**  
• Highlight that while both theories share core assumptions, they diverge in understanding state behavior—Morgenthau's focus on human nature versus Waltz's emphasis on system structure.

### Answer

Classical Realism, as articulated by Hans Morgenthau in his seminal work *Politics Among Nations* (1948), and Neorealism, introduced by Kenneth Waltz in *Theory of International Politics* (1979), represent two significant schools of thought in international relations. While both theories share the foundational belief that international politics is driven by the pursuit of power and that the international system is anarchic, they differ in their focus, assumptions, and analytical approaches.

One of the primary differences lies in the understanding of human nature. Classical Realism, as espoused by Morgenthau, emphasizes the inherently flawed and selfish nature of humans. Morgenthau argues that international politics is driven by the "will to power" rooted in human nature. According to Morgenthau, leaders act out of a desire to dominate, and conflicts arise due to this inherent lust for power. His theory is grounded in a philosophical view that power politics is an inevitable consequence of human nature. Morgenthau states, "Politics, like society in general, is governed by objective laws that have their roots in human nature."

In contrast, Kenneth Waltz's Neorealism—also known as Structural Realism—shifts the focus from human nature to the structure of the international system. Waltz argues that it is not the inherent characteristics of humans that drive states' behavior, but rather the anarchic nature of the international system. According to Waltz, the lack of a central authority compels states to act in a self-help manner, prioritizing survival and security. In *Theory of International Politics*, Waltz posits that the distribution of power (whether the system is unipolar, bipolar, or multipolar) determines the behavior of states. Thus, while Morgenthau focuses on individual leaders and their motivations, Waltz sees the structure of the international system as the primary determinant of state behavior.

Another major difference is their approach to power. Classical Realism views power primarily in terms of military capabilities and political influence. Morgenthau asserts that the pursuit of power is the main goal of states, leading to competition and conflict. Neorealism, however, conceptualizes power in more structural terms. Waltz argues that power is not an end in itself but a means to achieve security. States seek to balance power in the international system to ensure their survival, and the balance of power is seen as a stabilizing force in global politics.

Additionally, Classical Realism tends to focus on the moral and ethical dimensions of statecraft. Morgenthau acknowledges the role of ethics in international relations but is skeptical about its influence, given the realities of power politics. Neorealism, on the other hand, is more scientific and structural in its approach, dismissing the role of morality in the anarchic system. Waltz's Neorealism seeks to establish a more rigorous, objective analysis of international relations, focusing on empirical patterns of state behavior.

For example, during the Cold War, Morgenthau would argue that the U.S.-Soviet rivalry was fueled by the leaders' desire for dominance, whereas Waltz would contend that the bipolar structure of the international system made this conflict inevitable.

While both Classical Realism and Neorealism share core assumptions about power and anarchy, they differ in their understanding of what drives state behavior—Morgenthau focuses on human nature and power politics, while Waltz emphasizes the structure of the international system and the quest for security.

## Q.6) Is Realism the best method to understand international relations? Examine this in the context of classical Realism. (2017) (20 Marks)

### Approach to write the answer

**Introduction:**  
• Introduce classical Realism as a key framework in international relations, focused on power, self-interest, and survival in an anarchic global system.

**Body:**  
• Explain its strengths in understanding power dynamics and state behavior but highlight its limitations in addressing international cooperation, non-state actors, and transnational challenges in the modern world.

**Conclusion:**  
• Conclude that while classical Realism offers valuable insights into power politics, it is not the "best" method for understanding all aspects of today's complex global system, requiring complementary frameworks.

### Answer

Realism, particularly classical Realism, has long been regarded as one of the most influential frameworks for understanding international relations (IR). Rooted in the writings of thinkers like Thucydides, Thomas Hobbes, and later Hans Morgenthau, Realism is based on the premise that international relations are driven primarily by the pursuit of power, self-interest, and survival in an anarchic global system. While Realism has been foundational in shaping IR theory, its suitability as the "best" method for understanding global politics is debated, especially when applied to the complexities of the modern world.

Classical Realism emphasizes the inherently conflictual nature of international relations. It posits that states, as rational actors, are primarily concerned with their own survival and security. As Hans Morgenthau outlines in *Politics Among Nations* (1948), power is the primary currency in international relations, and moral considerations are often subordinate to the pursuit of national interest. For example, during the Cold War, Realist principles seemed to explain the behavior of superpowers like the United States and the Soviet Union, which engaged in power balancing, nuclear deterrence, and strategic alliances to maximize their security in a competitive international environment.

One of the strengths of classical Realism is its focus on power politics and the idea of anarchy in the international system. In the absence of a central authority, states operate in a "self-help" system, where trust is minimal, and conflicts of interest are inevitable. This framework has helped explain numerous historical events, such as the balance of power strategies in Europe during the 19th and 20th centuries. John Mearsheimer, a contemporary proponent of Realism, has argued in *The Tragedy of Great Power Politics* that states will always seek to maximize their relative power, and that competition, rather than cooperation, is the defining characteristic of international relations.

However, while Realism provides a robust framework for understanding power dynamics and state behavior, it has limitations in explaining some key aspects of modern international relations. Critics argue that it downplays the importance of international institutions, norms, and non-state actors, which have become increasingly relevant in the globalized world. Liberal theorists, such as Robert Keohane in *After Hegemony*, argue that institutions like the United Nations and the World Trade Organization help mitigate anarchy by fostering cooperation, reducing uncertainty, and promoting interdependence among states.

Furthermore, Realism often overlooks the role of domestic politics and ideology in shaping foreign policy. Classical Realism assumes that states act as unitary, rational actors, but scholars like Graham Allison, in his Bureaucratic Politics Model, show that internal politics and bureaucratic struggles can heavily influence international decision-making, such as during the Cuban Missile Crisis.

Realism also struggles to account for the rise of non-state actors and transnational threats, such as terrorism, climate change, and global health crises. These challenges require multilateral cooperation, diplomacy, and international governance—factors that Realism, with its focus on state-centric power politics, tends to underestimate.

While classical Realism remains an essential method for understanding international relations, especially in terms of power dynamics and conflict, it is not necessarily the "best" method for comprehensively explaining the complexities of today's global system. Its focus on state behavior and power struggles provides valuable insights, but its limitations in addressing international cooperation, non-state actors, and transnational issues suggest that other frameworks, such as Liberalism or Constructivism, are also necessary to fully understand the evolving landscape of international relations.

## Q.7) Identify the major differences between the classical Realism of Hans J Morgenthau and the Neorealism of Kenneth Waltz. Which process is the best suited for analysing international relations after the cold war? (2015) (10 Marks)

### Approach to write the answer

**Introduction:**  
• Introduce the major differences between Morgenthau's classical realism and Waltz's neorealism, both rooted in the realist tradition but differing in their focus on power and state behavior.

**Body:**  
• Explain that classical realism centers on human nature and individual state leaders, while neorealism emphasizes the international system's structure and state survival in an anarchic system.

**Conclusion:**  
• Highlight that neorealism is more suited for analyzing post-Cold War power dynamics, while classical realism remains relevant for understanding leadership and moral dilemmas in global politics.

### Answer

The major differences between the classical realism of Hans J. Morgenthau and the neorealism of Kenneth Waltz lie primarily in their understanding of power, human nature, and the structure of the international system. Both theories are rooted in the realist tradition, which emphasizes the role of power and an anarchic international system. However, Morgenthau's classical realism focuses on human nature as the driver of state behavior, while Waltz's neorealism (or structural realism) emphasizes the international system's structure as the primary determinant of state actions.

Classical realism, as articulated by Hans J. Morgenthau in his seminal work *Politics Among Nations* (1948), is based on the assumption that politics is governed by objective laws rooted in human nature. Morgenthau believed that humans are inherently selfish and power-seeking, and this drives states to pursue their national interests in an anarchic international system. He argued that moral considerations are often subordinated to the pursuit of power, and that the international system is characterized by a constant struggle for dominance. Morgenthau's classical realism focuses on the importance of individual state leaders and their decisions, and he emphasized that states act in a world where power politics prevails, making conflict inevitable.

On the other hand, neorealism, as developed by Kenneth Waltz in *Theory of International Politics* (1979), shifts the focus away from human nature and individual state leaders to the international system itself. Waltz argued that the structure of the international system, defined by anarchy and the distribution of capabilities among states, dictates state behavior. Unlike Morgenthau, who saw power in broad, multifaceted terms, Waltz viewed power as relative capabilities that determine a state's position in the international system. Neorealism is thus more systemic, emphasizing the pressures exerted by the anarchic system on states to maximize security and balance against threats. Waltz contended that states, as rational actors, act primarily to ensure their survival, which leads to predictable patterns of behavior such as balancing and bandwagoning.

The question of which approach is best suited for analyzing international relations after the Cold War can be debated. Neorealism has been particularly influential in explaining post-Cold War dynamics, especially in a unipolar world where the United States emerged as the dominant power. Waltz's emphasis on the structure of the international system helps to explain how states responded to U.S. hegemony, with theories of balancing and power transition coming into play. Neorealism also provides insights into the behavior of rising powers like China, which are seen to challenge the existing power structure.

However, classical realism can also offer valuable insights, especially when considering the role of leadership and ideology in post-Cold War conflicts, such as the rise of populism and nationalism in global politics. Morgenthau's emphasis on the role of human nature and the moral dilemmas of power politics can be useful for understanding contemporary leaders' actions in unpredictable conflicts, such as the war in Iraq or Russia's annexation of Crimea.

While both approaches offer valuable insights, neorealism is better suited for analyzing the broader structural shifts and power transitions that have characterized international relations since the Cold War. However, classical realism still holds relevance for understanding the role of individual decision-making and human nature in international politics. Both perspectives continue to complement each other in analyzing the complexities of global power dynamics.

## Q.8) Examine major principles of state centric world-views. (2013) (20 Marks)

### Approach to write the answer

**Introduction:**  
• Introduce state-centric worldviews as emphasizing the state's role as the primary actor in international relations, grounded in realism.

**Body:**  
• Explain key principles like state sovereignty, national interest, territorial integrity, and non-intervention, citing examples like the Cold War and Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.

**Conclusion:**  
• Highlight that while globalization challenges state-centric ideas, these principles remain essential in understanding international relations, with the state still the dominant actor.

### Answer

State-centric worldviews are rooted in the belief that the state is the primary and most important actor in international relations, and that its sovereignty, territorial integrity, and self-determination are paramount. This perspective is anchored in the principles of realism, which emphasizes the centrality of the state, national interest, and the anarchic nature of the international system. The key principles of state-centric worldviews have been shaped by scholars such as Hans Morgenthau, Kenneth Waltz, and others within the realist and neo-realist schools of thought.

One of the foundational principles of state-centric worldviews is state sovereignty. According to the Westphalian model established in 1648, sovereignty is the concept that each state has authority over its territory and domestic affairs, free from external interference. As Morgenthau articulates in *Politics Among Nations* (1948), sovereignty is the cornerstone of international politics, where states seek to preserve their autonomy in an international system marked by competition. The state's role as the final arbiter of law and authority within its borders is seen as sacrosanct, and violations of this principle, such as external intervention, are considered threats to the global order.

Another key principle is national interest. Realists argue that the primary goal of the state is to ensure its own survival and security in a world where no overarching authority can enforce rules. Kenneth Waltz, in *Theory of International Politics* (1979), introduced the concept of structural realism, where the international system is anarchic, meaning that states must rely on self-help to protect their interests. This often leads to power politics and balance-of-power strategies, where states seek to enhance their power to deter threats or maintain equilibrium. For example, during the Cold War, the United States and the Soviet Union engaged in an intense arms race to maintain the balance of power, driven by the desire to protect their national interests.

Territorial integrity is another core principle of state-centric views. States are defined by their territorial boundaries, and maintaining these borders is seen as essential to statehood. Violations of territorial integrity, such as invasion or annexation by other states, are viewed as significant threats to the global order. This principle was tested during the 1990 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, which led to a global outcry and military intervention by a U.S.-led coalition to restore Kuwait's territorial sovereignty.

The principle of non-intervention is also central to state-centric worldviews. It reflects the idea that states should not interfere in the internal affairs of other states. This principle is enshrined in the United Nations Charter (Article 2, Section 7), which underscores respect for the sovereignty and domestic jurisdiction of states. However, the rise of humanitarian interventions and the Responsibility to Protect (R2P) doctrine challenges this principle, showing tension within the state-centric model when global norms confront state sovereignty.

The major principles of state-centric worldviews—state sovereignty, national interest, territorial integrity, and non-intervention—continue to shape the way states interact in the international system. While globalization and transnational issues like climate change and human rights have challenged these ideas, state-centric principles remain fundamental to understanding international relations in a world where the state is still the primary actor.

## Q.9) Write a note on intellectual precursor of Realism. (2013) (10 Marks)

### Approach to write the answer

**Introduction:**  
• Introduce Realism's intellectual roots in the writings of thinkers who emphasized power, self-interest, and anarchy in international politics.

**Body:**  
• Discuss key precursors like Thucydides, Machiavelli, Hobbes, and Clausewitz, who laid the groundwork for Realism by highlighting power struggles, state survival, and the anarchic nature of politics.

**Conclusion:**  
• Conclude that these thinkers shaped modern Realist theory, contributing lasting insights on power, conflict, and state behavior in international relations.

### Answer

Realism, as a dominant theory in international relations, finds its intellectual precursors in the writings of key thinkers throughout history who emphasized the centrality of power, self-interest, and the anarchic nature of international politics. These thinkers, spanning from ancient to early modern times, laid the foundational principles of Realism long before it was formally developed as a theory in the 20th century.

One of the earliest intellectual precursors of Realism is the ancient Greek historian Thucydides. In his work *The History of the Peloponnesian War*, Thucydides documented the conflict between Athens and Sparta, highlighting how fear, self-interest, and power drive state behavior. He famously wrote, "the strong do what they can and the weak suffer what they must," encapsulating the Realist belief that international politics is governed by power struggles rather than ideals of justice or morality. Thucydides' emphasis on the anarchic structure of the international system, where there is no overarching authority to enforce rules, is a core principle of modern Realism.

Another significant intellectual precursor is Niccolò Machiavelli, whose work *The Prince* (1513) is a cornerstone of Realist thought. Machiavelli argued that rulers must prioritize the survival and security of the state above all else, often by using cunning, deception, and, if necessary, cruelty. He dismissed the notion that rulers could govern based on moral principles alone, asserting that "the ends justify the means." Machiavelli's pragmatic view of politics, focusing on power and self-interest rather than ethics, strongly influenced Realist thinkers in international relations.

Thomas Hobbes, a 17th-century English philosopher, further contributed to Realism through his conception of human nature and the state of nature in *Leviathan* (1651). Hobbes described the state of nature as a condition of perpetual conflict, where life is "solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short" due to the absence of a higher authority to maintain order. This notion of anarchy, where each individual (or state) must fend for itself, closely mirrors the Realist view of international relations, where states operate in an anarchic international system, driven by the need for survival and security.

Moving into the early modern period, Carl von Clausewitz, a Prussian military theorist, also influenced Realist thinking with his work *On War* (1832). Clausewitz emphasized that war is a continuation of politics by other means, reflecting the Realist belief that military power and conflict are inevitable aspects of international relations.

The intellectual precursors of Realism—Thucydides, Machiavelli, Hobbes, and Clausewitz—contributed core ideas about power, self-interest, anarchy, and conflict that are foundational to modern Realist theory. Their insights into the nature of human behavior and the dynamics of political power continue to shape the Realist understanding of international relations, where the struggle for power and security remains central.

## Q.10) What is 'complex interdependence'? Discuss the role of transnational actors in the international system. (2021) (15 Marks)

### Approach to write the answer

**Introduction:**  
• Define complex interdependence, introduce Robert Keohane and Joseph Nye's contribution, and how it contrasts with traditional realism in international relations.

**Body:**  
• Explain the key characteristics of complex interdependence (multiple channels, no hierarchy among issues, reduced role of military force), and illustrate with examples of MNCs, NGOs, and international organizations shaping global policy.

**Conclusion:**  
• Summarize how complex interdependence highlights the role of non-state actors and the increasing significance of global cooperation in an interconnected world.

### Answer

The concept of "complex interdependence" was introduced by Robert Keohane and Joseph Nye in their seminal work *Power and Interdependence* (1977). It challenges the traditional realist view of international relations, which focuses primarily on state-centric power politics and military force. Complex interdependence suggests that, in an increasingly interconnected world, states and non-state actors are linked by multiple channels of communication and interaction—ranging from economic, environmental, and technological exchanges to social and cultural connections. These interactions diminish the utility of military power, elevate the importance of economic and social cooperation, and increase the role of transnational actors in shaping global affairs.

Complex interdependence is characterized by three primary features. First, there are multiple channels of interaction between states, including government-to-government, business-to-business, and people-to-people networks. Second, there is no hierarchy among issues; military security is no longer the dominant concern, as economic, environmental, and social issues become equally important. Third, the use of military force is significantly less effective in resolving disputes, as cooperation and negotiation become the primary means of managing international relations.

In this context, transnational actors—such as multinational corporations (MNCs), non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and international organizations—play a critical role in the international system. These actors operate across national borders, shaping policy agendas, influencing governments, and facilitating cooperation among states. For instance, multinational corporations like Apple and Google wield significant economic power and influence global supply chains, impacting both domestic and international economic policies. According to a report by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), MNCs account for about one-third of global output and two-thirds of world trade, illustrating their immense influence in the global economy.

NGOs also play a crucial role in promoting human rights, environmental protection, and social justice. Organizations such as Amnesty International and Greenpeace work independently of states but exert pressure on governments and international institutions to adopt policies aligned with their goals. For example, Greenpeace's campaigns against climate change have led to greater awareness and action on environmental issues, influencing international agreements like the Paris Climate Accord.

International organizations like the United Nations (UN) and the World Trade Organization (WTO) further exemplify complex interdependence by facilitating cooperation among states on issues like global trade, peacekeeping, and public health. The World Health Organization (WHO), for instance, played a key role in coordinating the global response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Complex interdependence highlights the growing importance of non-state actors and the shift away from a purely state-centric international system. Transnational actors, including MNCs, NGOs, and international organizations, are increasingly shaping global policies, promoting cooperation, and addressing transnational challenges in an interconnected world. This evolving dynamic reflects the broader trend of globalization, where power and influence are dispersed among various actors beyond the traditional nation-state framework.

*End of Part 1 (Q1-Q10)*
