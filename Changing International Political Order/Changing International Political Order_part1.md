<a name="q3-rise-of-prc-as-a-great-power-and-asian-political-order"></a>
## **Q3: Critically examine the rise of People's Republic of China (PRC) as a great power and its implications on Asian Political order.** (2022, 20 Marks)

### 🎯 **Core Theme**
China's economic growth, military modernization, and strategic initiatives have reshaped Asia's political order, creating dependencies, tensions, and a shift toward multipolarity.

### 🔑 **Key Recall Terms**
- **Belt and Road Initiative (BRI)**: $1 trillion infrastructure investment
- **Debt-Trap Diplomacy**: Unsustainable debt leading to strategic control
- **Hambantota Port**: Sri Lankan port leased to China due to debt
- **People's Liberation Army (PLA)**: China's modernized military force
- **Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP)**: Asia-Pacific trade agreement

### 📝 **Answer Structure**

#### **Introduction**
- Since 1978 economic reforms under Deng Xiaoping:
  - China transformed into world's second-largest economy
  - Became major military power
- Reshaped Asia's political, economic, and security landscape
- John Mearsheimer argues:
  - China's rise exemplifies "offensive realism"
  - Great powers seek regional dominance
- Joseph Nye asserts:
  - China's strategy involves "soft power" elements
  - Alongside military capability

#### **Body**

*Economic Growth and Strategic Dependencies:*
- Average GDP growth exceeded 9% for decades
- China became central economic partner for many Asian countries
- Belt and Road Initiative (BRI):
  - Invested over $1 trillion in infrastructure across Asia
  - Creates economic dependencies
  - Strengthens political ties
- Deep strategic partnerships in:
  - Pakistan
  - Sri Lanka
  - Cambodia
- **Example**: Sri Lanka's Hambantota port
  - Unsustainable debt led to 99-year Chinese lease
  - Raises sovereignty concerns
  - Illustrates "debt-trap diplomacy"

- People's Liberation Army (PLA) modernization
- Military base establishment in South China Sea
- Reinforced strategic ambitions
- SIPRI data:
  - China's defense budget second-largest globally
- Assertiveness in territorial disputes with:
  - India
  - Japan
  - Southeast Asian nations
- Heightened tensions leading to regional arms race
- **Example**: South China Sea militarization
  - Prompted countries like Japan and India to enhance defense capabilities
  - Seek closer U.S. ties as counterbalance

#### **Body Point 3: Impact on Regional Multilateralism**
While participating in ASEAN and Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), China promotes regional order aligned with its interests, challenging post-WWII liberal order. Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP)—Asia-Pacific trade agreement excluding U.S.—reflects China's vision of multipolar Asia.

**Example**: RCEP's 2020 signing created world's largest free trade bloc without U.S. participation, shifting economic gravity toward China.

#### **Body Point 4: Regional Tensions and Counter-Alliances**
China's rise compelled regional powers to form counter-alliances. QUAD (U.S., India, Japan, Australia) emerged as strategic counterbalance. India's Look East policy transformed into Act East, deepening security cooperation with Japan and Australia.

**Example**: QUAD's revival (2017) and focus on Indo-Pacific security reflects regional response to Chinese assertiveness.

#### **Conclusion**
China's ascent has redefined Asian political order by challenging traditional power structures and reshaping alliances. While economic and military strategies enhance standing, they create regional tensions and dependencies. The PRC's rise signals shift toward multipolar Asia where balance of power continues to evolve amid competing interests.

## **Q4: Critically examine the decline of the United States of America as a hegemon and its implications for the changing international political order.** (2021, 15 Marks)

### 🎯 **Core Theme**
U.S. hegemonic decline stems from relative economic power shifts, military overreach, and domestic polarization, leading to a multipolar world with implications for global stability and governance.

### 🔑 **Key Recall Terms**
- **Relative Decline**: Shift in comparative power rather than absolute decline
- **China's GDP (PPP)**: Surpassed U.S. in purchasing power parity
- **Afghanistan Withdrawal (2021)**: Symbol of strategic retreat
- **NSC-68**: Militarized containment strategy
- **Multipolar World**: Power distributed among multiple centers

### 📝 **Answer Structure**

#### **Introduction**

- Traditionally characterized by:
  - Unparalleled economic power
  - Military dominance
  - Cultural influence post-WWII
- U.S. dominance now questioned due to economic challenges and changing global dynamics
- Joseph Nye notes in *The Future of Power*:
  - While U.S. remains powerful
  - China's rapid growth and assertive foreign policy present formidable challenge

#### **Body**

*Economic Power Shift Towards Emerging Economies:*
- Relative shift in economic power toward emerging economies, particularly China, challenges U.S. dominance
- China's Belt and Road Initiative:
  - Expanding influence in Africa and Latin America
  - Growing military capabilities
  - Challenges U.S. strategic and economic dominance
- IMF data shows China's GDP in purchasing power parity (PPP) terms surpassed U.S.
- Indicates shifting economic balance
- **Example**: China's GDP (PPP) exceeding U.S. marks symbolic shift in global economic gravity

*Military Overreach and Credibility Damage:*

  - Drained resources
  - Diminished credibility
- U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan (2021):
  - After two decades
  - Raised questions about commitment and capability

  - Eroded economic base and soft power appeal
- **Example**: Afghanistan war (2001-2021)
  - Cost over $2 trillion
  - Minimal strategic gains
  - Culminating in Taliban's return to power

*Domestic Political Polarization:*
- Divisive American politics weakened coherence of foreign policy
- Trump administration's retreat:
  - From multilateralism
  - From international agreements
  - Led allies and rivals to question stability of U.S. leadership
- This uncertainty allowed China, Russia, and EU to assert influence in multilateral institutions
- **Example**: U.S. withdrawal from Paris Climate Accord (2017) and Iran Nuclear Deal
  - Undermined credibility as reliable partner

*Implications for International Order:*
- As power becomes diffused, multipolar world emerges
- Regional powers like China, Russia, and EU play larger roles
- John Mearsheimer suggests in *The Tragedy of Great Power Politics*:
  - Multipolar world is inherently less stable
  - Increased conflict risks
- As U.S. influence wanes:
  - Emerging powers may prioritize national interests over collective security
- **Example**: Competing visions in UN Security Council reforms reflect multipolar contestation

#### **Conclusion**
- U.S. hegemony decline signals shift toward multipolar world order
- Significant implications for global stability and governance
- Transition may lead to:
  - Increased competition
  - Instability as emerging powers assert interests
  - Absence of single stabilizing superpower
- Evolving landscape calls for new approaches to multilateralism and international cooperation

### 👨‍🎓 **Scholars Referenced**
- **Joseph Nye**: *The Future of Power* - relative power shifts
- **Stephen Walt**: Costs of military overreach
- **John Mearsheimer**: *The Tragedy of Great Power Politics* - multipolar instability

### 📚 **Key Examples**

- **Example**: Cambodia's blocking of ASEAN statements critical of China's South China Sea activities

*Trade Dynamics and Supply Chain Shifts:*
- U.S.-China trade war disrupted global supply chains
- Pushed companies to relocate from China to Southeast Asia
- Benefiting Vietnam, Thailand, and Bangladesh
- Creates economic vulnerabilities:

  - Opportunities: Investment, strategic partnerships
  - Challenges: Security tensions, threatened autonomy, trade disruptions
- Region's future stability depends on:
  - Maintaining balanced approach
  - Maximizing benefits of engagement with both powers

- Without Soviet backing:
  - Countries like Cuba, Vietnam, and North Korea faced economic hardships
- Cuba entered "Special Period" after Soviet collapse:

- Gave U.S. greater leverage to push neoliberal economic policies:
  - Through IMF and World Bank
- Critics argue these policies:
  - Focusing on austerity and structural adjustments
  - Sometimes hindered growth
  - Deepened inequality in developing world
- **Example**: Structural Adjustment Programs (SAPs) in Sub-Saharan Africa
  - Conditionalities led to public service cuts
  - Increased poverty in some cases

*Negative Impact—Regional Conflicts and Instability:*
